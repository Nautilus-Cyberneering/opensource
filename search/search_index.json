In order to do this we will research about how successfully existing open source communities work. Tech From a technical side, although all we need to make a previously closed source project open source is to put the source code online, it is highly recommended to check a couple of things before jumping and publishing our project: Check if our project is able to be open source . This means that any libraries we use must be under a compatible license. Choose an open source license . It is easy to publish something under a free license, but you can not un-publish it after or at least it could be counterproductive for our reputation. Also check if our software is usable without any closed source applications . Sometimes software depends on 3rd party components. If this is the case for our application, we have to make sure these components are also available under open source licenses or make sure that the software is either compatible with open source alternatives or is usable without them. In case we held any software patents which apply to our project , we should release a statement that we will not use our patent to prohibit the development and distribution of the program or derivatives. Allow developers to easily start working on the project . Provide clear instructions how to checkout the code, compile, configure and deploy it. Try to avoid requiring custom tools or a very complicated toolchain to build the software from source. Make sure that we provide everything that is needed to compile the project. Basic project set-up instructions could be included in the very first version of a README file. Try to solve worse possible vulnerabilities . As the sourcecode will be available, it becomes easier for others to find vulnerabilities, and at the same time easier for others to provide patches, but it can take time. We also should be sure to remove any corporate secrets from the codebase, like passwords, cryptographic keys or similar, following the Kerckhoffs's principle: \u201cA (crypto)system should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.\u201d. In addition to this, and taking the suggestions of Gregorio Robles based on Eric S. Raymond\u2019s essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar , software developed using the bazaar model (in which the code is developed over the Internet in view of the public) should exhibit the following patterns: Users should be treated as co-developers . The users are treated like co-developers and so they should have access to the source code of the software. Furthermore, users are encouraged to submit additions to the software, code fixes for the software, bug reports, documentation, etc. Having more co-developers increases the rate at which the software evolves. Linus's law states, \"Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow.\" This means that if many users view the source code, they will eventually find all bugs and suggest how to fix them. Note that some users have advanced programming skills, and furthermore, each user's machine provides an additional testing environment. This new testing environment offers the ability to find and fix a new bug. Early releases . The first version of the software should be released as early as possible so as to increase one's chances of finding co-developers early. Frequent integration . Code changes should be integrated (merged into a shared code base) as often as possible so as to avoid the overhead of fixing a large number of bugs at the end of the project life cycle. Some open-source projects have nightly builds where integration is done automatically on a daily basis. Several versions . There should be at least two versions of the software. There should be a buggier version with more features and a more stable version with fewer features. The buggy version (also called the development version) is for users who want the immediate use of the latest features, and are willing to accept the risk of using code that is not yet thoroughly tested. The users can then act as co-developers, reporting bugs and providing bug fixes. High modularization . The general structure of the software should be modular allowing for parallel development on independent components. Dynamic decision-making structure . There is a need for a decision-making structure, whether formal or informal, that makes strategic decisions depending on changing user requirements and other factors. People Although software development is an important part of the project success, the fundamental part to build a healthy community is people. We have to think not only in ways to attract talent but also on how to motivate them to participate, contribute and feel part of the project. Everything is around people. Our open-source community will be more willing to contribute to our project if they feel a sense of inclusiveness, and beyond this, if we can give them a sense of ownership of the project. In order to to this we need to provide them some infrastructure: Offer communication platforms for our community to discuss the development of the project. This could be done in several ways: Email list. Google Group. GitHub page. Discord. Twitter. Forums. Blog. Create spaces to meet . We could organise/collaborate/participate in industry related events: Meetups. Conferences. Workshops. Hackathons. Contests. Have people available to manage and moderate our communication channels and community contribution processes. In the future we might want to outsource this to trusted community members, but in the meantime we will need to handle this on our own. It is extremely important that those members in charge have good people and communications skills, and it is also absolutely critical that they are able to recognise good ideas from others. Always be welcoming, polite, and respectful ; this will show our goodwill toward people. Keep in mind that contributors could come from all around the world with different cultures, origins, and native languages, and their English might not be perfect. Stay open and tolerant. In general, our open source community needs to offer a harassment-free experience for all users, regardless of their age, ethnicity, gender, nationality, sexual identity, or religion. Promote alternative and varied ways to contribute . Do not forget that there are many different ways to contribute to an open source project, not only coding: Using and spreading the word about our project. Organising events (e.g., meetups, conventions) Designing (e.g., mock-ups, specs) Writing (e.g., documentation, tutorials, video tutorials, blogs) Gardening (e.g., sorting issues and pull requests, moderating the forum) Helping on the forum, chat, or other communication channels. To sum up, understanding the reasons why people contribute to our project will help us understand our community and our users. We have to try to meet them in real life at events and meetups, chat with them on social networks, and just ask them why they are participating. Documentation Good documentation is a mark of seriousness . If it is not available, people will look for another project. Just like good code, proper documentation is difficult and time consuming to write. In fact, according to GitHub, 93% of people consider incomplete or outdated documentation to be a major problem. We have to make sure that all our processes are kept transparent for potential contributors : To do so, we will be sure to: Update the documentation regularly. Write it in a way that is easy to contribute to. Label it appropriately so that it will be easy for newbies to scan on the issues and get started. For example, create files like \u201cfor newbies\u201d, \u201csmall bugs to resolve\u201d, or \u201cimprove documentation\u201d. In our docs, we must include at least: - A description of the project, what it does, what it does not do (if needed), the current roadmap, and the distribution license - How to install and a list of prerequisites - Basic instructions for end users - Basic instructions for maintainers (run, updates, monitor, etc.) - How to build from source - How to contribute - How to write code (the expected standards per language) - How to write and run tests - A list of dependencies and their licenses - A list of all the software's extension systems and how to use them with examples (e.g., modules, themes, hooks, APIs, etc.) - Links to tutorials and interesting technical content on other websites - Ways to contribute to the project other than code Lastly, do not forget to make people who land on our open source project feel welcome . Thank them for their interest in our open source project, using clear and accessible language. A few words of kindness can prevent someone from leaving our project.

The license element is also heavily affected by the ideological stance that the authors take. On the other hand, there exists also the possibility to follow a dual licensing strategy which, however, is not always the right choice depending on the OSSP owners pursued goal and ideology. In essence one can say that a great part of OSSP business models generally focus on services related to the use of their OSSP software, this however, stemming from the ideological advocates that Open-Source Software should be free in all aspects. 1.5.1 Impact of Ideology on the creation of a Busines Model When it comes to the ideology there exist essentially two different definitions for Open-Source Software. One definition advocating that Open-Source Software should always be free and the other leaving the door open to charging for Open-Source Software. One side represented by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) advocates the GNU-GPL licensing approach and philosophy and defines software freedom to have 4 essential elements (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html): \u2022 Freedom to run a program anytime and for any purpose. \u2022 Freedom to study how the program works and be able to adapt it to your needs. \u2022 Freedom to re-distribute copies. \u2022 Freedom to improve the code and release any improvements that you have made to the public. In addition to these 4 points, it is also considered that a reasonable distribution fee for the distribution of the Open-Source Software and its manuals can be charged. However, the software should be considered by this party as essentially free with no additional cost. The FSF ideology is also reflected in the GPL licensing approach which stands for these values and demands that any contribution and changes to any underlying project to this license be made public. On the other side stands the Open-Source Initiative (OSI) which advocates 10 criteria (https://opensource.org/docs/osd) similar in many aspects to the FSF but it also makes a point in that not all Open Source software will be 100% free of usage restriction, such as defined by the FSF. The OSI leaves thus the door open the commercialization of any underlying software as a product, thus expanding the possible business model and sources of revenue that a OSSP can consider. 1.5.2 The Nature of Software and its possible Business Models Software is essentially a different good or product if compared to more traditional products and services. Software is different in that it can be easily modified, copied, and distributed and that it is not physical, so that software producers can offer a wide range of products and features with little extra cost and with different pricing models. These qualities make it crucial to consider the licensing question from the start for intellectual property protection when considering business models. In addition to this the real value that customers derive from it stems from its use and its worth can only be assessed once the software has been tried. Customer loyalty in software is often tied to the potential switching costs which is essentially the time & money spent on learning and maintaining the software. On top of this all stakeholder in the distribution chain are linked creating dynamic network effects. Vendors, partners, and customers are linked when it comes to the determination of the overall value of the software. The more people use it, provide it and distribute it the more cumulative value it has. Some obvious examples to show these network effects would be: \u2022 A software that does not have users is of no value or interest to be distributed nor sold or maintained by companies. \u2022 A software that does not have a network of partners cannot offer good support solutions to companies. \u2022 A software whose vendors are few, is difficult to get, expand, etc. The nature of software creates a challenge in the conception of a viable business model such as happens with any new technology, research, or innovation where it can be the case that the market is not ready yet and no current customer need exists for it. Thus, if one intends to create a viable business model one must focus on delivering to an already existing market need or must create a new market for it, which can be a long and costly path. 1.5.3 Essential activities that software companies generate value with The activities through which software companies generate value are basically these: \u2022 Services \u2022 Product centered services \u2022 Products \u2022 Products distributed as services (SAAS) Each activity having its different specific implications in terms of the offer, customers, market approach, etc. that can be summarized in the following table: 1.5.4 Value Creation Activities and Revenue Potential Essentially OSSP software producers and any software company can consider the following representation to envision the revenue potential grossly and where they could fall into: Depending on the choice of business model and licensing the possibilities will move along the given axis. 1.5.5 Possible Business Models The business models that are available to an Open-Source Project are in essence the same as those of any other software company: \u2022 Support services. \u2022 Dual licensing. \u2022 Proprietary extensions or \u201cOpen Core Licensing\u201d. \u2022 Leveraging OSS to sell other products or services.

Guide to Open Source Business Models - Leveraging a Free and Open Source Software framework to develop commercialization strategies for IT Research & Development projects. 10.13140/2.1.4393.7281. The following business models, however, are different in their applicability depending on the chosen license and their potential customers, growth and success drivers. 1.5.5.1 Business Model: Support Services The pure support services business model is possible for all OSSP. However, for projects that are FREE and run under Copyleft licenses such as the GNU/GPL license, these are the only possible approach. The GPL license prevents the OSSP software to become proprietary and sold at considerable margins since its source code and modifications must always be freely available and no vendor can generate a differentiation based on the code. This fact creates an interesting situation where the software has almost no cost for customers and companies must create income through their complementary service offering. Customers Below is a simple overview of the three generic customers with the possible services from a FREE OSSP vendor: Source: Martin, Donald & Foulonneau, Muriel. (2014). Guide to Open-Source Business Models - Leveraging a Free and Open Source Software framework to develop commercialization strategies for IT Research & Development projects. 10.13140/2.1.4393.7281. Growth and Success Drivers When considering the market growth drivers and potential we first must consider the customer base, and who else is competing with us. In the case of the different FREE OSSP the competition is on two fronts, other FREE OSSP providers and proprietary software providers. The challenges here are twofold, to move away customers from proprietary solutions and to differentiate effectively from other FREE OSSP vendors. When it comes to the drivers for success, they are dependent on the competitive environment: Source: Martin, Donald & Foulonneau, Muriel. (2014).

In addition to this there is an inherent factor that defines the success or failure of the support service model: the growth and popularity of the OSSP. If the OSSP software does not convince customers as the better solution for their software needs, the support service model will unlikely become a viable option. Examples Linux kernel \u2013 (RED HAT, NOVELL, CANONICAL) BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS: SUPPORT SERVICES ] 1.5.5.2 Business Model: Dual Licensing The dual licensing model is in essence that there exist two sets of code one freely available and one proprietary that is made available in exchange for payment, or that the customer buys the rights to modify the code for commercial purposes and does not want to make public any improvements made to the code. Copyright law gives the author of the work the right to license however they wish to whomever they wish. Customers The same customers apply as for the support services model who through dual licensing can get access to closed code not freely available or they request for custom developments that they want to be proprietary. Growth and Success Drivers Overall development costs of the software in comparison to other proprietary solutions are lower since much of the development and testing have been done FOSS community. This allows the copyright holder to offer lower cost pricing models to attract customers away from similar proprietary solutions. The offered solution must be perceived as a superior or equal technical solution to other commercial and FOSS software alternatives. In addition, to this the dual licensing approach opens the possibility to offer advanced consulting and or development services to companies who want their own custom solutions based on the OSSP solution, but do not have the necessary expertise in-house. Also, dual licensing can be applied in combination with other business models such as the support services for the Free code. Where for example the company can provide all the services from this model to the free version of the code. Clear separation of the two code versions, proprietary and FOSS. Procedures in place to avoid the proprietary code \u201ccontamination\u201d, like assigning establishing the procedure that contributors must first assign the copyright to the owners of the project before any contributions are accepted. Examples MYSQL Apatar Pentaho BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS: Dual Licensing 1.5.5.3 Business Model: Proprietary extensions or \u201cOpen Core Licensing\u201d The Open Core business model is the creation of an OSSP base solution to a problem or need that is free. This \u201ccore\u201d application already creates significant value but it can be amplified through non \u2013 open-source, proprietary extensions or components from vendors. Customers The same as for any software company in the previous business models, developers, companies, institutions and individuals. Growth and Success Drivers Key for success is to establish the elements that are to be contained in the Open Core solution as a minimum viable value solution and which elements will be available for a fee. Another challenge for a company pursuing this business model is which strategy they will employ to handle the customers\u2019 fears of vendor lock-in, when wanting to access advanced solutions or additional features. This fear is one of the reasons why some customers choose Open-Source solutions since they do not want to rely on a single vendor. An approach for example to overcome this fear can be seen in the strategy of some companies. These companies start charging a fee for additional extensions or components which then however, at a later stage are moved gradually to the open-source version. Key in this case is that the company must have control over the IP of the community developed version and the additional components developed \u201cin-house.\u201d The success of this model is enhanced if the vendor of complementary proprietary code is also the key supporter of the Free Open-Source Community. Examples Mindtouch Docker Elastic Gitlab MongoDB Redis BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS: Proprietary extensions or \u201cOpen Core Licensing\u201d 1.5.5.4 Business Model: Leveraging FOSS to sell Other Complementary Products or Services This model approach centers on creating income not related to FOSS services or for the software itself. Making money of the sale of goods or services that cannot not exist without the other, like: \u2022 Cars and fuel \u2022 Web browsers and UI interfaces \u201creal estate\u201d \u2022 Website CMS and hosting services \u2022 Hardware and its operating systems \u2022 Computers and operating systems \u2022 Servers and database management software \u2022 Mobile phones and their operating systems This approach can take many forms among others: - SAAS (Software As A Service) platforms which are a method of software delivery and licensing in which the software is accessed online via a subscription, rather than bought and installed on individual computers. - The creation of products or services which are related to it like hardware that uses the FOSS. - The sale of related digital \u201creal estate\u201d. Customers The customers for this model depend on the market need that the underlying FOSS software fulfills. The customers can be everyone from private to professionals, individuals, companies, and other institutions. For example, one of the main incentives for customers to use this type of solutions is that they can control and budget exactly the related costs. Growth and Success Drivers For this model to work a large customer base is needed and the software run as an application needs to address a need of the target market, reason for which companies that apply it will need to have dedicated resources to develop and support the application, without impeding the additional development of related services. It is also key for companies to understand all the licensing implications from using the open-source software. Understanding the legal implications as to how the open-source code licensing does affect the development of the related products or services is essential to prevent legal claims. Examples Complementary Products: Mozilla.org & Mozilla Corporation (Web browser & Web browser \u201creal estate\u201d) Mozilla is the nonprofit organization owner of the FOSS its free product being the Firefox browser. Mozilla Corporation is not for profit subsidiary or the Mozilla organization who gets money from companies. This way it gets funds to develop its Mozilla organization\u2019s FOSS project. One customer for example is Google. Google, tasks Mozilla Corporation with incorporating the Google search bar in each base product. Mozilla as a group then receives funds to develop and sustain its FOSS and community. Digium (PBX Producer) & Asterisk PBX FOSS Digium supports the Asterisk FOSS embedded in its electronic products, lowering its overall development, and testing costs, gaining competitiveness with overall lower costs. Android & Mobile Phones and Tablets Google supports the Android FOSS mobile operating system given the mobile phone market potential. Google with this strategy aims to position itself with applications and search advertising services on the mobile phone screens. The strategy works since it helps to lower overall software development costs for mobile phone hardware producers who embrace this software. Complementary Service: Wordpress.org & Wordpress.com (CMS & Hosting with advanced services) Wordpress.org is the worlds most popular CMS, FOSS with a strong GPL license that does force all developments done by its community to be made public and reincorporated into the project. Wordpress.com however is the for-profit company of one of its authors who offers a hosting services in different subscription packages for Wordpress.org\u2019s CMS software, and different levels of customizable services build into the service and software offer. BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS: Leveraging FOSS to sell Other Complementary Products or Services 1.5.6 Additional questions to be asked when establishing the possible business model or model combination. Key questions that should be asked when evaluating a FOSS business model: \u2022 Does the software create a new product category or does it significantly improve upon or challenge products in an existing product category? \u2022 Is it difficult for consumers to find viable replacements for the product in this category? \u2022 Are the demands of the target market not being adequately met today? Why? \u2022 What is size of the developer population that would be interested in adopting this product category? \u2022 For IT departments, in addition to the FOSS software that has been made available to the development community, what related products, tools or services could be sold to IT managers who need to save time or money?

Based on the copyright protection automatically granted to all original works, a software license (basically a set of formal permissions from the copyright holder ) may include specific \"conditions\" of use, and are an important part of the legally binding contract between licensor (the copyright owner of the code) and the recipient (the \"licensee\"). Without a license agreement, software may be left in a state of legal uncertainty in which potential users may not know which limitations owners may want to enforce , and owners may leave themselves vulnerable to legal claims or have difficulty controlling how their work is used. Types of Software Licenses In brief, software licensing strategies can be divided into three categories: \"proprietary,\" \"free and open source,\" or a hybrid of the two. Proprietary Licensing: The primary purpose of a proprietary software license is to limit the use of software according to the rights owner's business strategy . They typically allow use of the software only for its stated purpose, often only on a single computer, forbid users from copying, redistributing, or altering the work, and specifically prohibit the creation of derivatives using parts of the work. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Licensing: Free and open source software (FOSS) represents a fundamentally different approach to software licensing. The primary intent of FOSS is to maximize openness and minimize barriers to software use, dissemination, and follow-on innovation. Hybrid Software Licensing: \"Hybrid\" (also called dual- or multi-licensing) is the result of combining a FOSS license with a proprietary \"closed\" license, in cases that software developers' needs are not well met by using exclusively one of the approaches mentioned above. As our project is strongly oriented to the open source community, we are going to focus only on FOSS licenses . Elements Common To All Free and Open Source Licenses All FOSS licenses grant free (as in freedom), open, and non-discriminatory access and rights to modify licensed software and associated source code. This means that: Anyone can use the software for any purpose. Anyone can modify the software's source code. Anyone can redistribute the software, in both original and modified form, to anyone else. A common misconception is that FOSS is synonymous with \"noncommercial\", but in fact, by the two most influential definitions of FOSS ( FSF and OSI ), \"non-discriminatory\" means that no category of user or distributor can be prohibited , including for-profit commercial entities. So this way FOSS-licensed software can be, and regularly is, commercially exploited. As the Free Software Foundation states in their website, \"Free software\" is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of \"free\" as in \"free speech,\" not as in \"free beer\". We sometimes call it \"libre software,\" borrowing the French or Spanish word for \"free\" as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis. Thus, a program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms : The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2). The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.- Virtually all free and open source licenses also include a prominent disclaimer of liability , so that the licensor cannot be held responsible if the code (even in unmodified form) causes a recipient's computer to melt. Elements That Vary Across Open Source Licenses In addition to the core freedoms described above, some open source licenses include some additional conditions. Usually these conditions place certain demands on the recipient, or constraints on the recipients' behavior, in exchange for the recipient's right to use and redistribute the code. Copyleft versus Permissive \"Copyleft\" and \"Permissive\" are terms used to compare legal philosophies and attributes of FOSS licenses to traditional proprietary licenses. Copyleft: A license that not only grants the freedoms mentioned above but furthermore requires that those freedoms apply to any derivative works . Requiring as a condition of the license that any derivative works also be distributed under the same licensing terms as the original, these copyleft licensing terms are also sometimes referred to as reciprocity or \"share-alike\" provisions, and because of these reciprocity requirements, copyleft licenses are considered \"restrictive\" licenses, though these restrictions guarantee perpetual open access. Examples of popular copyleft FOSS licenses include the GNU General Public License (GPL) , GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) , and the Mozilla Public License (MPL) . The GNU Licenses are the most well known of all the FOSS licenses and have a strong community of supporters and advocates. Of these, the GPL has the strongest reciprocity requirements and is considered a \"strong\" copyleft license. The LGPL (the \"Lesser GPL,\" denoting its weaker copyleft requirements) is very similar to the GPL from which it is derived, but allows for linking to proprietary code under certain circumstances. Similarly, the MPL allows copyleft to be applied to some parts of the code and not others. The LGPL and MPL are considered a compromise between the strong copyleft of GPL and permissive licenses such as the BSD/MIT. Permissive or non-copyleft: A license that grants the freedoms mentioned above but that does not have a clause requiring that they apply to derivative works as well . Permissively licensed software may be incorporated into \"closed\" proprietary programs with no requirement that the source code be disclosed if the combined software is distributed. Examples of popular permissive FOSS licenses include the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) , MIT and Apache licenses. The BSD and MIT licenses are often mentioned interchangeably due to very similar language and terms that accomplish largely identical goals. The primary intent of these licenses is to allow the use, distribution, and modification of your code for any purpose, while making sure that you as the creator receive credit for your work. The Apache license is similar in effect to the BSD/MIT, but include a license for patents related to the software (this can be desirable or not, depending on the situation). Below is a list of licenses in descending order from strong copyleft at the top to completely non-copyleft at the bottom : GNU Affero General Public License version 3 AGPL-3.0 GNU General Public License version 3 GPL-3.0 Mozilla Public License 2.0 MPL-2.0 GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 3 LGPL-3.0 MIT license MIT Apache License 2.0 Apache-2.0 BSD 2-Clause (\"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\") license BSD-2-Clause Permissions, conditions and limitations Open source licenses grant the public permissions to do things with licensed works that copyright or other \"intellectual property\" laws would not otherwise permit. Most open source licenses grant permissions subject to compliance with certain conditions . In addition to this, most open source licenses also have limitations that typically disclaim warranty and liability, and sometimes expressly exclude patents or trademarks from license grants. For reference, here is a table of every license mentioned above.

Our process to choose the license for Boken Engine Measuring popularity The first thing we did was to know a little bit more about the adoption of popular licenses mentioned above. The results were the following: In 2015 , according to a internal research from GitHub about license usage on GitHub.com, MIT (almost 45% of projects), GNU Public Licenses (almost 25%) and Apache (more than 11%) are the clear front runners , with some 15% of licensed projects opting for a non-standard license or standard license not among those listed on choosealicense.com. Developers use GitHub because they want to share their code with the world, and the data suggests that when the tools GitHub provides make it a little bit easier, developers do just that. When presented with the option, they choose to license, and they license very permissively. An external research of trends from 2018 to 2020 (excluding repositories that do not have a license file) got the following conclusions: Over half of the repositories use either the Apache 2.0 or MIT license One third of repositories use some form of custom license text. The remaining 13% contain a large variety of licenses of which the BSD and variations of the GNU Public Licenses are the most common. An interesting finding was that a sizeable number of repositories still used the older versions of the BSD and GPL licenses . In summary across 2018 and 2019: 352 repositories use BSD 2 and 1,562 use the newer BSD 3 841 repositories use GPL 2.0 and 2,114 use GPL 3.0 The data also suggests that many individual contributors do not understand the importance of including a license file in the projects they open source. A more recent research show some latest trends: Apache 2.0 license takes the lead at the expense of MIT license. In general, the use of permissive open source licenses continues to rise . The preference is for licenses with fewer restrictions and limitations. Usage of copyleft licenses , especially GPL licenses, continues to decrease . Going permissive at first The first option was to choose the MIT license as a way to start from a blank slate , just have a license and continue working. MIT license is short, very easy to understand, and allows anyone to do anything so long as they keep a copy of the license, including your copyright notice. You will be able to release the project under a different license if you ever need to. Based on the same flexibility that MIT provides, another option was Apache 2.0 . After that we realized that was better to invest some time in thinking about the implications it might have in the future. Having an almost \"do whatever you want\" license could have some undesirable side effects . Maintaining freedom through restrictions Although a permissive license may seem ideal because of the freedom it provides, both for the creator of the software and the user, at the same time it also provides the freedom to the latter to modify and distribute it under different terms and without source code. That means this piece of source code could be easily (and legally) turned into a close source software (proprietary program) without the obligation of sharing it, which in the end weakens the open source community. Schematic representation of license directionality, from A Quick Guide to Software Licensing for the Scientist-Programmer , \u00a9 Morin et al. In general, permissively licensed code is forward compatible with any other license type. However, only permissive licenses, such as the BSD and MIT, can feed into other permissive licenses. Restrictive licenses like the GPL are backward compatible with themselves and permissive licenses, but must adopt the restrictive license from then on. Proprietary licenses can incorporate upstream permissively licensed code, but by definition are incompatible with any other downstream license. Grey represents actions that are not permitted without negotiating a separate license agreement with the rights owner. Proprietary software developers have the advantage of money; free software developers need to make advantages for each other. Using strong copyleft licenses for a code instead of permissive and some weak copyleft licenses gives free software developers an advantage over proprietary developers : a code that they can use, while proprietary developers cannot use it. Proprietary software developers, seeking to deny the free competition an important advantage, will try to convince authors not to contribute to strong copyleft libraries. For example, they may appeal to the ego, promising \"more users for this library\" if we let them use the code in proprietary software products. Popularity is tempting, and it is easy for a library developer to rationalize the idea that boosting the popularity of that one library is what the community needs above all. In our particular case we want to make sure our framework remains free software for all its users so we start considering the different options for copyleft licenses. We considered Creative Commons licenses (in particular the Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)) but quickly found many sources that advised against it. Even the Creative Commons organization itself advises against using CC licenses for software , and actually they use free and open source software licenses for their own software. Some of the main arguments against using it are the following: Unlike software-specific licenses, CC licenses do not contain specific terms about the distribution of source code. CC licenses are currently not compatible with the major software licenses, so it would be difficult to integrate CC-licensed work with other free software. Among the list of FOSS licenses, the GNU GPLv3 lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions . And this seemed to be like an ideal fit for our intentions. In brief, GNU GPLv3 estipulates that permissions of the license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications , which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license . Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. A slightly step back We were almost decided to go for GNU GPL license for our project, but then we got some information about the fact that creating a framework to build iOS applications with this license could turn in some legal troubles . After doing additional research we found some cases of conflicts on publishing Open Source software on Apple's App Store. Basically the matter is that Apple's App Store terms of service impose extra restrictions which are, by nature, incompatible with the GPL. So we started to think about other alternatives : LGPL, Dual licensing, etc. but the line between legal and problematic was starting to get thinner and crossing it (even unintentionally) could harm the project. After that we analise the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) , which is a weak copyleft license , providing a middle ground between the liberal MIT/BSD/Apache licenses and the GPL licenses. In addition is, by default, compatible with LGPL and GPL version 2 or greater. In fact, others have also opted for this license after facing the same problems with Apple App Store and GPL licensed source code we mentioned above. The most significant case was VLC, pulled in from App Store due to a licensing dispute caused by the fact that all versions of VLC were then open-source and licensed under GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. Subsequent VLC version for iOS was licensed under both the Mozilla Public License 2.0 as well as the GNU General Public License version 2 (or later) so the MPL-2.0 version of the software was applicable for distribution on the App Store again. Some of the features and requirements of this license are: Permissions of this license are conditioned on making available source code of licensed files and modifications of those files under the same license (or in certain cases, one of the GNU licenses. Copyright and license notices must be preserved . Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights . However, a larger work using the licensed work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for files added in the larger work. The license notice must be in some way \"attached\" to each file . As mentioned above, license makes it really easy to incorporate the code into larger works, but it is very interesting to consider some things if you plan to to this. An important point here is the \"larger works\" part: The MPL-2.0, section 3.3, permits anyone to combine original source code with code under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, or any later version of that license, to make a Larger Work, and distribute the result under the GPL. The only condition is that you must also make the original source code, and any changes you have made to it, available to recipients under the terms of the MPL-2.0 also. Anyone who receives the combined code (dual licensed as MPL/GPL) from you does not have to continue to dual licence in this way, and may, if they wish, distribute the program as a whole under the terms of the chosen GNU license, but the MPL-covered files will be dual-licensed, so that recipients can choose to distribute them under that GNU License or the MPL. However, some creators of MPL licensed software discourage people from distributing copies of the original source code under the GPL alone, because it means that any improvements they make cannot be reincorporated into the main version of the original source code. There is never a need to do this for license compatibility reasons. Other creators choose to opt out of this GPL compatibility in advance by adding a notice to its header source files. On the other hand, the fact that it does not automatically extend to other files within the same project makes it easy to extend a library without releasing the relevant additions neccesary as free software, as long as the MPL-licensed components remain accessible under the terms of the MPL. By allowing proprietary modules in derived projects while requiring core files to remain open source, the MPL is designed to motivate both businesses and the open-source community to help develop core software . That said, we opt for Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) , mainly because of its versatility and compatibility with other licenses. The known cases of going back from GPL to MPL to allow the publication on Apple's App Store are also a strong reason to take this decision. For all these reasons we consider MPL-2.0 as the best option for our project at this moment. How to include license on source code To apply the Mozilla Public License to software that we have written, we have to add the header from Exhibit A of the license to each source code file in our project. This page gives copy-and-pasteable license headers for Mozilla code. When adding license headers to new files always we have to use the appropriate one of the suggested there. As a reference here is the raw text. This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/. This license text must be used for all new code , unless the containing project, module or externally-imported codebase uses a different license. If we can not put a header in the file due to its structure, we could put it in a LICENSE file in the same directory. However, while the license permits putting the header somewhere other than the file itself, individual files often end up being distributed on their own, without the rest of the software they were authored with. As a result, putting the license notice in the file is the surest way to ensure that recipients are always notified, so we strongly encourage to do so as far as possible . We may also add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership, such as the name of the copyright holder, although this is not necessary. As the project is initially released, a \"Copyright [TBD]Copyright Holder\" notice is required in the headers of all source files . New files added should also include a license header with a \"[TBD]Copyright Holder\" copyright notice, whether the file is created by internal or external developer. From a legal perspective, leaving \"[TBD]Copyright Holder\" in the headers does not affect the contributors' rights . Most contributors do not care about this, especially for small patches. By default, contributors (or their employers) hold copyright on their contributions , whether or not we note that publicly, and the commit log is the most accurate record of their work. But it is reasonable to want special public credit for your work. To that end, contributors may be recognized creating and maintaining AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS files . This requires ongoing maintenance but builds goodwill among our contributors. When project start accepting a great deal of external code, we may wish to optionally update the copyright statements in our source code to a generic \"Copyright 2021 The Boken Authors\" also to acknowledge the community's efforts . Rather than attempting to modify the headers for the project to list every single contributor, we can follow these steps to create additional visibility for contributor acknowledgment . Again, the git history will be the best source of truth as to copyright ownership for each contribution. Update the copyright statements in our LICENSE file and all file headers to list \"The Boken Authors\" rather than \"[TBD]Copyright Holder\": Before: Copyright 2021 [TBD]Copyright Holder After: Copyright 2021 The Boken Authors. Create a top-level file named AUTHORS, which will identify the copyright holders of the project. This is an list of people who have contributed to the codebase which lives in this repository. [TBD]Copyright Holder Ada Lovelace Alan Turing ... It is not necessary to proactively list the contributor for every single contribution we receive. Rather, it is sufficient to add contributors when they request to be added. Adding contributors to the AUTHORS file is entirely within the project's discretion and has no implications for copyright ownership . Note about Copyright and copyleft From GNU site To copyleft a program, we first state that it is copyrighted; then we add distribution terms, which are a legal instrument that gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program's code, or any program derived from it, but only if the distribution terms are unchanged. Thus, the code and the freedoms become legally inseparable. Proprietary software developers use copyright to take away the users' freedom; we use copyright to guarantee their freedom. That's why we reverse the name, changing \"copyright\" into \"copyleft.\" Copyleft is a way of using the copyright on the program. It doesn't mean abandoning the copyright; in fact, doing so would make copyleft impossible. The \"left\" in \"copyleft\" is not a reference to the verb \"to leave\"\u2014only to the direction which is the mirror image of \"right\".

Based on the copyright protection automatically granted to all original works, a software license (basically a set of formal permissions from the copyright holder ) may include specific \"conditions\" of use, and are an important part of the legally binding contract between licensor (the copyright owner of the code) and the recipient (the \"licensee\"). Without a license agreement, software may be left in a state of legal uncertainty in which potential users may not know which limitations owners may want to enforce , and owners may leave themselves vulnerable to legal claims or have difficulty controlling how their work is used.","title":"Why Software Licenses Are Important"},{"location":"choose-a-license/#types-of-software-licenses","text":"In brief, software licensing strategies can be divided into three categories: \"proprietary,\" \"free and open source,\" or a hybrid of the two. Proprietary Licensing: The primary purpose of a proprietary software license is to limit the use of software according to the rights owner's business strategy . They typically allow use of the software only for its stated purpose, often only on a single computer, forbid users from copying, redistributing, or altering the work, and specifically prohibit the creation of derivatives using parts of the work. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Licensing: Free and open source software (FOSS) represents a fundamentally different approach to software licensing. The primary intent of FOSS is to maximize openness and minimize barriers to software use, dissemination, and follow-on innovation. Hybrid Software Licensing: \"Hybrid\" (also called dual- or multi-licensing) is the result of combining a FOSS license with a proprietary \"closed\" license, in cases that software developers' needs are not well met by using exclusively one of the approaches mentioned above. As our project is strongly oriented to the open source community, we are going to focus only on FOSS licenses .","title":"Types of Software Licenses"},{"location":"choose-a-license/#elements-common-to-all-free-and-open-source-licenses","text":"All FOSS licenses grant free (as in freedom), open, and non-discriminatory access and rights to modify licensed software and associated source code. This means that: Anyone can use the software for any purpose. Anyone can modify the software's source code. Anyone can redistribute the software, in both original and modified form, to anyone else. A common misconception is that FOSS is synonymous with \"noncommercial\", but in fact, by the two most influential definitions of FOSS ( FSF and OSI ), \"non-discriminatory\" means that no category of user or distributor can be prohibited , including for-profit commercial entities. So this way FOSS-licensed software can be, and regularly is, commercially exploited. As the Free Software Foundation states in their website, \"Free software\" is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of \"free\" as in \"free speech,\" not as in \"free beer\". We sometimes call it \"libre software,\" borrowing the French or Spanish word for \"free\" as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis. Thus, a program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms : The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2). The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.- Virtually all free and open source licenses also include a prominent disclaimer of liability , so that the licensor cannot be held responsible if the code (even in unmodified form) causes a recipient's computer to melt.","title":"Elements Common To All Free and Open Source Licenses"},{"location":"choose-a-license/#elements-that-vary-across-open-source-licenses","text":"In addition to the core freedoms described above, some open source licenses include some additional conditions. Usually these conditions place certain demands on the recipient, or constraints on the recipients' behavior, in exchange for the recipient's right to use and redistribute the code.","title":"Elements That Vary Across Open Source Licenses"},{"location":"choose-a-license/#copyleft-versus-permissive","text":"\"Copyleft\" and \"Permissive\" are terms used to compare legal philosophies and attributes of FOSS licenses to traditional proprietary licenses. Copyleft: A license that not only grants the freedoms mentioned above but furthermore requires that those freedoms apply to any derivative works . Requiring as a condition of the license that any derivative works also be distributed under the same licensing terms as the original, these copyleft licensing terms are also sometimes referred to as reciprocity or \"share-alike\" provisions, and because of these reciprocity requirements, copyleft licenses are considered \"restrictive\" licenses, though these restrictions guarantee perpetual open access. Examples of popular copyleft FOSS licenses include the GNU General Public License (GPL) , GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) , and the Mozilla Public License (MPL) . The GNU Licenses are the most well known of all the FOSS licenses and have a strong community of supporters and advocates. Of these, the GPL has the strongest reciprocity requirements and is considered a \"strong\" copyleft license. The LGPL (the \"Lesser GPL,\" denoting its weaker copyleft requirements) is very similar to the GPL from which it is derived, but allows for linking to proprietary code under certain circumstances. Similarly, the MPL allows copyleft to be applied to some parts of the code and not others. The LGPL and MPL are considered a compromise between the strong copyleft of GPL and permissive licenses such as the BSD/MIT. Permissive or non-copyleft: A license that grants the freedoms mentioned above but that does not have a clause requiring that they apply to derivative works as well . Permissively licensed software may be incorporated into \"closed\" proprietary programs with no requirement that the source code be disclosed if the combined software is distributed. Examples of popular permissive FOSS licenses include the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) , MIT and Apache licenses. The BSD and MIT licenses are often mentioned interchangeably due to very similar language and terms that accomplish largely identical goals. The primary intent of these licenses is to allow the use, distribution, and modification of your code for any purpose, while making sure that you as the creator receive credit for your work. The Apache license is similar in effect to the BSD/MIT, but include a license for patents related to the software (this can be desirable or not, depending on the situation). Below is a list of licenses in descending order from strong copyleft at the top to completely non-copyleft at the bottom : GNU Affero General Public License version 3 AGPL-3.0 GNU General Public License version 3 GPL-3.0 Mozilla Public License 2.0 MPL-2.0 GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 3 LGPL-3.0 MIT license MIT Apache License 2.0 Apache-2.0 BSD 2-Clause (\"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\") license BSD-2-Clause","title":"Copyleft versus Permissive"},{"location":"choose-a-license/#permissions-conditions-and-limitations","text":"Open source licenses grant the public permissions to do things with licensed works that copyright or other \"intellectual property\" laws would not otherwise permit.

The results were the following: In 2015 , according to a internal research from GitHub about license usage on GitHub.com, MIT (almost 45% of projects), GNU Public Licenses (almost 25%) and Apache (more than 11%) are the clear front runners , with some 15% of licensed projects opting for a non-standard license or standard license not among those listed on choosealicense.com. Developers use GitHub because they want to share their code with the world, and the data suggests that when the tools GitHub provides make it a little bit easier, developers do just that. When presented with the option, they choose to license, and they license very permissively. An external research of trends from 2018 to 2020 (excluding repositories that do not have a license file) got the following conclusions: Over half of the repositories use either the Apache 2.0 or MIT license One third of repositories use some form of custom license text. The remaining 13% contain a large variety of licenses of which the BSD and variations of the GNU Public Licenses are the most common. An interesting finding was that a sizeable number of repositories still used the older versions of the BSD and GPL licenses . In summary across 2018 and 2019: 352 repositories use BSD 2 and 1,562 use the newer BSD 3 841 repositories use GPL 2.0 and 2,114 use GPL 3.0 The data also suggests that many individual contributors do not understand the importance of including a license file in the projects they open source. A more recent research show some latest trends: Apache 2.0 license takes the lead at the expense of MIT license. In general, the use of permissive open source licenses continues to rise . The preference is for licenses with fewer restrictions and limitations. Usage of copyleft licenses , especially GPL licenses, continues to decrease .","title":"Measuring popularity"},{"location":"choose-a-license/#going-permissive-at-first","text":"The first option was to choose the MIT license as a way to start from a blank slate , just have a license and continue working. MIT license is short, very easy to understand, and allows anyone to do anything so long as they keep a copy of the license, including your copyright notice. You will be able to release the project under a different license if you ever need to. Based on the same flexibility that MIT provides, another option was Apache 2.0 . After that we realized that was better to invest some time in thinking about the implications it might have in the future. Having an almost \"do whatever you want\" license could have some undesirable side effects .","title":"Going permissive at first"},{"location":"choose-a-license/#maintaining-freedom-through-restrictions","text":"Although a permissive license may seem ideal because of the freedom it provides, both for the creator of the software and the user, at the same time it also provides the freedom to the latter to modify and distribute it under different terms and without source code. That means this piece of source code could be easily (and legally) turned into a close source software (proprietary program) without the obligation of sharing it, which in the end weakens the open source community. Schematic representation of license directionality, from A Quick Guide to Software Licensing for the Scientist-Programmer , \u00a9 Morin et al. In general, permissively licensed code is forward compatible with any other license type. However, only permissive licenses, such as the BSD and MIT, can feed into other permissive licenses. Restrictive licenses like the GPL are backward compatible with themselves and permissive licenses, but must adopt the restrictive license from then on. Proprietary licenses can incorporate upstream permissively licensed code, but by definition are incompatible with any other downstream license. Grey represents actions that are not permitted without negotiating a separate license agreement with the rights owner. Proprietary software developers have the advantage of money; free software developers need to make advantages for each other. Using strong copyleft licenses for a code instead of permissive and some weak copyleft licenses gives free software developers an advantage over proprietary developers : a code that they can use, while proprietary developers cannot use it. Proprietary software developers, seeking to deny the free competition an important advantage, will try to convince authors not to contribute to strong copyleft libraries. For example, they may appeal to the ego, promising \"more users for this library\" if we let them use the code in proprietary software products. Popularity is tempting, and it is easy for a library developer to rationalize the idea that boosting the popularity of that one library is what the community needs above all. In our particular case we want to make sure our framework remains free software for all its users so we start considering the different options for copyleft licenses. We considered Creative Commons licenses (in particular the Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)) but quickly found many sources that advised against it. Even the Creative Commons organization itself advises against using CC licenses for software , and actually they use free and open source software licenses for their own software. Some of the main arguments against using it are the following: Unlike software-specific licenses, CC licenses do not contain specific terms about the distribution of source code. CC licenses are currently not compatible with the major software licenses, so it would be difficult to integrate CC-licensed work with other free software. Among the list of FOSS licenses, the GNU GPLv3 lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions . And this seemed to be like an ideal fit for our intentions. In brief, GNU GPLv3 estipulates that permissions of the license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications , which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license . Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights.","title":"Maintaining freedom through restrictions"},{"location":"choose-a-license/#a-slightly-step-back","text":"We were almost decided to go for GNU GPL license for our project, but then we got some information about the fact that creating a framework to build iOS applications with this license could turn in some legal troubles . After doing additional research we found some cases of conflicts on publishing Open Source software on Apple's App Store. Basically the matter is that Apple's App Store terms of service impose extra restrictions which are, by nature, incompatible with the GPL. So we started to think about other alternatives : LGPL, Dual licensing, etc. but the line between legal and problematic was starting to get thinner and crossing it (even unintentionally) could harm the project. After that we analise the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) , which is a weak copyleft license , providing a middle ground between the liberal MIT/BSD/Apache licenses and the GPL licenses. In addition is, by default, compatible with LGPL and GPL version 2 or greater. In fact, others have also opted for this license after facing the same problems with Apple App Store and GPL licensed source code we mentioned above. The most significant case was VLC, pulled in from App Store due to a licensing dispute caused by the fact that all versions of VLC were then open-source and licensed under GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. Subsequent VLC version for iOS was licensed under both the Mozilla Public License 2.0 as well as the GNU General Public License version 2 (or later) so the MPL-2.0 version of the software was applicable for distribution on the App Store again. Some of the features and requirements of this license are: Permissions of this license are conditioned on making available source code of licensed files and modifications of those files under the same license (or in certain cases, one of the GNU licenses. Copyright and license notices must be preserved . Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights . However, a larger work using the licensed work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for files added in the larger work. The license notice must be in some way \"attached\" to each file . As mentioned above, license makes it really easy to incorporate the code into larger works, but it is very interesting to consider some things if you plan to to this. An important point here is the \"larger works\" part: The MPL-2.0, section 3.3, permits anyone to combine original source code with code under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, or any later version of that license, to make a Larger Work, and distribute the result under the GPL. The only condition is that you must also make the original source code, and any changes you have made to it, available to recipients under the terms of the MPL-2.0 also. Anyone who receives the combined code (dual licensed as MPL/GPL) from you does not have to continue to dual licence in this way, and may, if they wish, distribute the program as a whole under the terms of the chosen GNU license, but the MPL-covered files will be dual-licensed, so that recipients can choose to distribute them under that GNU License or the MPL. However, some creators of MPL licensed software discourage people from distributing copies of the original source code under the GPL alone, because it means that any improvements they make cannot be reincorporated into the main version of the original source code. There is never a need to do this for license compatibility reasons. Other creators choose to opt out of this GPL compatibility in advance by adding a notice to its header source files. On the other hand, the fact that it does not automatically extend to other files within the same project makes it easy to extend a library without releasing the relevant additions neccesary as free software, as long as the MPL-licensed components remain accessible under the terms of the MPL. By allowing proprietary modules in derived projects while requiring core files to remain open source, the MPL is designed to motivate both businesses and the open-source community to help develop core software . That said, we opt for Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) , mainly because of its versatility and compatibility with other licenses. The known cases of going back from GPL to MPL to allow the publication on Apple's App Store are also a strong reason to take this decision. For all these reasons we consider MPL-2.0 as the best option for our project at this moment.","title":"A slightly step back"},{"location":"choose-a-license/#how-to-include-license-on-source-code","text":"To apply the Mozilla Public License to software that we have written, we have to add the header from Exhibit A of the license to each source code file in our project. This page gives copy-and-pasteable license headers for Mozilla code. When adding license headers to new files always we have to use the appropriate one of the suggested there. As a reference here is the raw text. This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/. This license text must be used for all new code , unless the containing project, module or externally-imported codebase uses a different license. If we can not put a header in the file due to its structure, we could put it in a LICENSE file in the same directory. However, while the license permits putting the header somewhere other than the file itself, individual files often end up being distributed on their own, without the rest of the software they were authored with. As a result, putting the license notice in the file is the surest way to ensure that recipients are always notified, so we strongly encourage to do so as far as possible . We may also add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership, such as the name of the copyright holder, although this is not necessary. As the project is initially released, a \"Copyright [TBD]Copyright Holder\" notice is required in the headers of all source files . New files added should also include a license header with a \"[TBD]Copyright Holder\" copyright notice, whether the file is created by internal or external developer. From a legal perspective, leaving \"[TBD]Copyright Holder\" in the headers does not affect the contributors' rights . Most contributors do not care about this, especially for small patches. By default, contributors (or their employers) hold copyright on their contributions , whether or not we note that publicly, and the commit log is the most accurate record of their work. But it is reasonable to want special public credit for your work. To that end, contributors may be recognized creating and maintaining AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS files . This requires ongoing maintenance but builds goodwill among our contributors. When project start accepting a great deal of external code, we may wish to optionally update the copyright statements in our source code to a generic \"Copyright 2021 The Boken Authors\" also to acknowledge the community's efforts . Rather than attempting to modify the headers for the project to list every single contributor, we can follow these steps to create additional visibility for contributor acknowledgment . Again, the git history will be the best source of truth as to copyright ownership for each contribution. Update the copyright statements in our LICENSE file and all file headers to list \"The Boken Authors\" rather than \"[TBD]Copyright Holder\": Before: Copyright 2021 [TBD]Copyright Holder After: Copyright 2021 The Boken Authors.

How do I create content using Boken Engine? The actual contents the engine is going to render are described in a file written using JSON , a text-based standard information exchange format. Although it is very powerful, in our description file only some easy structures are used. This JSON file must be included in the project along with catalogues with assets referenced in this file (see section Assets catalogues ), with the name StoryDescription.json 2. Some concepts regarding the contents Scenes : The views in which are organized the contents. You can think of them as \"slides\". Each scene is composed of Elements, Navigations Buttons, Branch Buttons and an optional audio track that will play when the user gets to this scene. Scene Elements : The individual entities that are displayed within the scene. At the moment of writing this, they can be images (loaded from JPEG files), text labels or rectangular coloured shapes. Transformations : The images and the text labels can be animated via \"transformations\". Currently, there are two kinds of transformations: scale (size) and rotation. They can be combined. Each transformation is defined by its type, the final value for the property (scale or rotation) and how many seconds it takes to reach this value. Navigation Buttons : Buttons at the bottom of the scene that can get you to the previous and the next scene. Depending on what the content creator decides, not all buttons (maybe none) may be present at a particular scene. Branches Buttons : Buttons that gets the user to a particular scene, not necesarilly the next or previous one. It can be used to make branches in the storyline of the contents and introduce non-linearity. 3. Horizontal layout properties By default, all properties refer to the portrait (vertical) version of the application. For some properties, the user may also specify the value to be used when the App is being used on landscape (horizontal) mode. This landscape mode is always optional, and if is not present, the vertical value will be used in all orientations. Property Landscape mode property Elements which applies to Description posX posXH All Position of the center of the elements, in the X-Axis of the relative screen space (0 to 1) posY posYH All Position of the center of the elements, in the Y-Axis of the relative screen space (0 to 1) scale scaleH Image Scale of the image, relative to its natural size fontSize fontSizeH TextLabel Font size, in points width widthH Shape Width of the rectangle, relative to the screen width height heightH Shape Width of the rectangle, relative to the screen height toValue toValue Transformations Final vale for the transformed property (size or angle) 4. Content description file structure The content description file must contain a valid \"application definition\" object, the structure of which is defined below, along with its sub-structures. If you are not familiarized with basic data types, please refer to \"Appendix A: basic data types\" Application definition: { \"appTitle\": String \"scenes\": [SceneDescription] \"backgroundMusic\": String String // Name of a MP3 resource within the Bundle. Optional } Scene description: { \"sceneId\": String \"elements\": Elements \"navigation\" // Possible values: next | back | both | none \"branches\": [Branch] // Optional \"audio\": String // Name of a WAV resource within the Bundle. Optional \"background\": String // Possible values: \"white\", \"black\". Optional } Branch { \"label\": String \"target\": String // Reference to the sceneId of the destination scene } Elements: { \"elementsArray\": [subclass-of-ElementDescription] } Note : Position of the elements in the array matters. Please check next section to know more. ElementDescription { \"type\": String // Possible values: \"textLabel\", \"image\", \"shape\" \"posX\": Float \"posY\": Float \"posXH\": Float // Optional \"posYH\": Float // Optional } ShapeDescription (subclass of ElementDescription) { \"width\": Float \"height\": Float \"color\": String \"widthH\": Float // Optional \"heightH\": Float // Optional } ImageDescription (subclass of ElementDescription) { \"imageFile\": String // Name of a JPEG resource within the Bundle \"scale\": Float \"scaleH\": Float // Optional \"transformations\": [TransformationDescription] } TextLabelDescription (subclass of ElementDescription) { \"content\": String \"fontSize\": Float \"style\": String // Possible values: \"normal\", \"bold\", \"italic\", \"boldItalic\" \"fontSizeH\": Float // Optional \"transformations\": [TransformationDescription] // Optional } TransformationDescription: Decodable { \"type\": String // Possible values: \"scale\", \"rotation\" \"toValue\": Float \"toValueH\": Float // Optional } 5. Elements position and rendering precedence In the previous section we defined the collection of elements to be rendered as an array. Facing how the order in which the elements are going to be rendered (and thus, how they will overlap each other) we decided for simply corelate the position in the array with the render order (so the first elements in the array will be the first rendered, and could be overlaped by the other) and neglected introducing an explicit order property, to achieve simplicity in the elements collection changes and having a direct corelation between array order and render order, accepting implicit domain implications and semantics in the structure. 6. Assets catalogues There are three properties in the JSON file that refers to external files within the project structure: ImageFile of the Image Element description (JPEG) Audio of the Scene description (WAV) backgroundMusic of the App description (MP3) Those are references to assets that must be present inside the project as part of Assets Catalogues (.xcassets folders). A detailed explanation on how to create an asset catalog in your project is described at this Hacking with Swift's post but basically you have to do the following: Right-click on your project and choose \"New File\". From \"iOS\" choose \"Resource\" then \"Asset Catalog\", then click \"Next\" and name your catalog. You can now select your new asset catalog in Xcode, and drag pictures directly into it. Images stored inside asset catalog all retain their original filename, minus the path extension part. For example, \"king-castle.png\" will just appear as \"king-castle\" inside your asst catalog, and that's how you should refer to it while loading too. Asset catalogs automatically keep track of Retina and Retina HD images, but it's recommended that you name your images smartly to help make the process more smooth: king-castle.png, king-castle@2x.png and king-castle@3x.png are the best way to name your files for standard, Retina and Retina HD resolutions respectively. 7.

In order to do so, we will research about different types of governance models and the possibilities they offer. Choose an governance model What is a governance model Generally speaking the term \"governance\" can refer to a system of rules, roles, and procedures that determine how power in an organization gets distributed. It is about defining and managing \"The rules or customs that determine who gets to do what (or is supposed to do what), how they're supposed to do it, and when.\" . In the case of Open Source project and Community Governance is all about people , their rights and responsibilities as part of a project and the expectations others have for them. When analyzing your own governance systems, ask the following questions: What roles do (or can) project contributors play? What qualifies a person to play a particular role in the project? What duties, privileges, and forms of authority are associated with each role? What project resources are the province or responsibility of people who perform certain roles? How do various contributions get accepted into the project? How do contributors come to occupy and eventually depart from certain roles in the project? How can role descriptions and responsibilities be changed? How do project decisions get made (and by whom)? How are debates and conflicts resolved (and by whom)? Because Open Source projects are organizations, every one features governance structures . Some of these structures are more explicit than others. Some are more formal than others. But every project has them. Why governance model is important? Although the idea of \"governance\" could have a poor reputation in some Open Source communities (sometimes viewed as a set of rules or procedures aimed solely at telling people what they can't do, how they shouldn't act, or how they should limit themselves to acting only within certain boundaries), a clear and well-crafted governance model can in fact be a largely positive force, encouraging new contributors to become involved in your project , and is much less likely to turn away or de-motivate project participants than a vague or non-existent one is. So a community's goal in architecting a governance model should be, \"Make structures of participation obvious.\" When your project's rules are clear, contributors can engage with confidence. Taking this approach to governance can positively impact a project's long-term sustainability and growth. Even more, a good governance model will actually increase the agility of the project , as it defines how new contributors can take the project in unexpected directions without interfering with its core goals. It provides a mechanism for allowing the community as a whole to define the direction they feel the project should take , while ensuring that the core project team does not lose control. No matter how an Open Source project is structured. It is always necessary to define some mechanism for deciding how to make technical decisions . Someone, or some group, has to decide which commits to accept, which to reject, and more broadly what direction the project is going to take from a technical perspective. Here's an example of how valuable could be providing information: in 2018, the Kubernetes project Release Team added a set of detailed, comprehensive Role Handbooks , outlining information related to the Release Team role, including qualifications necessary for joining them, duties members of the team perform, and details on the team's decision-making processes. As a result, the Release Team became the most popular point of entry for project contributions , mainly because potential participants knew exactly what to do and expect. After that other teams at Kubernetes followed suit and experienced a doubling or even tripling of the number of new contributors. Types of governance models There are many ways to rule an Open Source project, but regardless of which one is chosen, a governance model should make the process of making and evaluating third party contributions easier, not harder . It should remove the uncertainty that can lead to wasted time for everyone involved. It is interesting to note that not all Open Source is truly open . Many Open Source projects are run by a single individual or controlled by a single vendor, and are quite closed in their governance. Other projects are welcoming of outside contributions, but are not open to outside contributors owning leadership roles that let them set technical strategy and direction. Governance models range from centralised control by a single individual or organisation (benevolent dictatorship) to distributed control awarded in recognition of contributions (democray). You can find governance models at any point along this spectrum . In fact, much more commonly, projects' governance models evolve and move along this spectrum as their communities grow and diversify. Founder-leader (aka \"BDFLs\" or \"Benevolent Dictators for Life\") The founder-leader governance model is most common among new projects or those with a small number of contributors (and since most Open Source projects have only a small number of contributors, this is a rather popular model!) In these projects, the individual or group who started the project also administers the project , establishes its vision and roadmap, controls all permissions to merge code into it, and assumes the right to speak for it in public. Some projects refer to their founder-leaders as \"BDFLs\" or \"Benevolent Dictators for Life,\" a term that is falling out of fashion. Although \"Benevolent Dictator\" may sound intimidating at first, it would be better to think of it as \"community-approved arbitrator\" or \"coordinator\". Generally, benevolent dictators do not actually make all the decisions, or even most of the decisions. It's unlikely that one person could have enough expertise to make consistently good decisions across all areas of the project, and anyway, quality developers won't stay around unless they have some influence on the project's direction. Therefore, benevolent dictators commonly do not dictate much . Instead, they let things work themselves out through discussion and experimentation whenever possible. Only when it is clear that no consensus can be reached , and that most of the group wants someone to guide the decision so that development can move on, does she put her foot down and say \"This is the way it's going to be\" . Consensus-based Democracy As projects get older, they tend to move away from the benevolent dictatorship model and toward more openly democratic systems , as \"Do-ocracy\" or \"Meritocracy\" (although this term carries negative connotations for some communities and has a complex social and political history). Consensus simply means an agreement that everyone is willing to live with . It is not an ambiguous state: a group has reached consensus on a given question when someone proposes that consensus has been reached and no one contradicts the assertion. The details of how these systems work vary widely, but there are two common elements: The group works by consensus most of the time . There is a formal voting mechanism to fall back on when consensus cannot be reached. Meritocracy. Power of those who have \"merit\" Democratic projects are normally auto governing and driven by the people who volunteer for the job. This is sometimes referred to as \"meritocracy\", and this functions well for most cases. In addition, the meritocratic model tries to give everyone a voice and reward those who make valuable contributions by providing mechanisms for recognition, such as increased visibility within the project. As with the benevolent dictator model, decisions are made by listening to the community and eventually taking action based on the consensus that emerges. However, in many cases there is no need for discussion, since the correct path is obvious. In this case, it is sufficient to simply state one's intentions and allow time for someone to object. In the absence of an objection, it is assumed that the community agrees with the proposed action. This is sometimes called \"lazy consensus\" . The effect of lazy consensus means that, in practice, most decisions within a meritocracy are made in a way that is very similar to that of projects operating under a benevolent dictator model . That is, once someone has earned the merit to allow them to define a course of action, the use of lazy consensus allows them to just go ahead and take whatever action they want. Just as a benevolent dictator could do. Inevitably, some debates just won't consense. When all other means of breaking a deadlock fail, the solution is to vote . But before a vote can be taken, there must be a clear set of choices on the ballot. It is important to note the controversial of the term \"merit\" , usually described as having the necessary ability or experience to do the job. However, meritocracies tend to promote those who not only have the skills/experience, but also the opportunity or possibility to let others know about it, priviledges that not everyone has to the same extent. Do-ocracy. Power of those who do Under a do-ocracy (sometimes called liberal contribution model), the people who do the most work are recognized as most influential, but in opposite to the previous model, this one is based on current work and not historic contributions . Again, major project decisions are made based on a consensus seeking process rather than pure vote , and strive to include as many community perspectives as possible. That said it's interesting to note that a particular governance style doesn't automatically imply a particular contribution model , although projects do tend to start as cathedral-style (a small core of dedicated contributions) benevolent dictatorships and move towards bazaar-style (contributions from broad sources) contribution or meritocratic-style governance (or both) as they mature. How to organise the governance When they reach a certain size, some open source projects under democratic models may appoint a number of leadership groups to govern various aspects of a project . Such groups may have names like \"steering committee,\" \"committer council,\" \"technical operating committee, \"architecture council,\" or \"board of directors.\" And typically, these groups construct their own decision-making conventions and succession procedures. In the same way some open source projects choose to conduct governance through elections . They may hold elections for various roles, or conduct similar electoral processes to ratify or update project policies and procedures. Under the electoral model, communities establish and document electoral procedures to which they all agree, then enact those procedures as a regular matter of decision-making. Those models of governance tend to lead to precise documentation of project roles, procedures, and participation guidelines. When election documents make these matters explicit, they help new contributors maximize their involvement in a project. About Open Governance It's important to point out that if users and contributors feel like they can't influence decisions about the future of the technology, projects have been known to fail or fork. Open Governance is an effective strategy to attract developers and IT industry players to a single Open Source project with the objective of attaining momentum faster. It looks to avoid community fragmentation and ensure the commitment of your contributors. When a project is under Open Governance in an ecosystem of active developers, the risk of the project being abandoned or not maintained at all is lower . They can trust that their contributions will be accepted based on what they do and what's best for the project, not what's best for a particular company. The reality is that open technology projects managed under Open Governance (the sort of Open Governance found in organizations such as Apache, Eclipse, Mozilla, and Linux) are demonstrably more successful (by an order of magnitude), have a longer life, and are less risky than projects that are controlled by a single vendor or are more restrictive in their governance. Some examples of governance through popular open source projects Apache Foundation projects Apache foundation was created in 1999 by a group of people, that called themselves the \"Apache Group\" to continue to support and maintain the HTTPD web server written by the NCSA. They self-organise around the basic principle of \"meritocracy\" . When the group felt that the person had \"earned\" the merit to be part of the development community, they granted direct access to the code repository. Their organization has various roles within each individual Apache project communities: User . A user is someone that uses Apache software, contribute by providing feedback to developers, and participate by helping other users on mailing lists and user support forums. Developer . A developer is a user who contributes to a project in the form of code or documentation. Developers are also known as contributors. Commiter . A committer is a developer that was given write access to the code repository and has a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file. PMC Member . A PMC member is a developer or a committer that was elected due to merit for the evolution of the project and demonstration of commitment. They have write access to the code repository, the right to vote for the community-related decisions and the right to propose an active user for committership. PMC Chair . The Chair of a Project Management Committee (PMC) is appointed by the Board from the PMC Members. The PMC as a whole is the entity that controls and leads the project. The Chair is the interface between the Board and the Project. PMC Chairs have specific duties. ASF member . An ASF member is a person who was nominated by current members and elected due to merit for the evolution and progress of the foundation. Members care for the ASF itself. They have the right to elect the board, to stand as a candidate for the board election and to propose a committer for membership. Regarding decision making, projects are normally auto governing and driven by the people who volunteer for the job. When coordination is required, decisions are taken with a lazy consensus approach : a few positive votes with no negative vote is enough to get going. The rules require that a negative vote includes an alternative proposal or a detailed explanation of the reasons for the negative vote. Python Python programming language was conceived in the late 80s by Guido van Rossum, who shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life . On that date he decided to remove himself entirely from the decision process, and delegate to the community the responsibility of taking decisions, starting with defining the way they wanted to take future decisions and define a new governance model. They use the PEPs formula to ask the community about the way they wanted to organise from that moment on, having different proposals: The Technical Leader Governance Model -- PEP 8010 . This PEP proposes a continuation of the singular technical project leader model , euphemistically called the Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) model of Python governance, to be henceforth called in this PEP the Gracious Umpire Influencing Decisions Officer (GUIDO). Python Governance Model Lead by Trio of Pythonistas -- PEP 8011 . This PEP proposes a governance model for the Core Python development community, led by a trio of equally authoritative leaders . The Trio of Pythonistas (ToP, or simply Trio) is tasked with making final decisions for the language. It differs from PEP 8010 by specifically not proposing a central singular leader, but instead a group of three people as the leaders . The Community Governance Model -- PEP 8012 This PEP proposes a new model of Python governance based on consensus and voting by the Python community . This model relies on workgroups to carry out the governance of the Python language. This governance model works without the role of a centralized singular leader or a governing council. The External Council Governance Model -- PEP 8013 This PEP proposes a new model of Python governance based on a Council of Auditors (CoA) tasked with making final decisions for the language. It differs from PEP 8010 by specifically not proposing a central singular leader , and from PEP 8011 by disallowing core committers from being council members . It describes the size and role of the council, how the initial group of council members will be chosen, any term limits of the council members, and how successors will be elected. The Commons Governance Model -- PEP 8014 This PEP proposes a governance model with as few procedures, defined terms and percentages as possible . It may also be called The Anarchist Governance Model but uses Commons for now because of possible negative connotations of the term Anarchist to some audiences. Organization of the Python community -- PEP 8015 . This PEP formalizes the current organization of the Python community and proposes 3 main changes : formalize the existing concept of \"Python teams\" ; give more autonomy to Python teams ; replace the BDFL (Guido van Rossum) with a new \"Python board\" of 3 members which has limited roles, mostly decide how a PEP is approved (or rejected). The Steering Council Model -- PEP 8016 This PEP proposes a model of Python governance based around a steering council. The council has broad authority, which they seek to exercise as rarely as possible; instead, they use this power to establish standard processes , like those proposed in the other 801x-series PEPs. To let community decide they set a private poll (using CIVS, a free Internet voting service) available for 2-week-long window on December 2018. Every committer received an email with a link allowing them to rank the proposals in their order of preference . The results of the election, including anonymized ballots, were public on December 17th, after the election ended. The whole details on the voting process were very well described in a PEP created for this specific purpose, and probably was the first community-wide decision they had to take. After the election completed the result was that PEP 8016: The Steering Council Model was selected as the winner . Then they defined the formal goverance process for Python around the steering council (a 5-person committee), which has broad authority but seek to exercise as rarely as possible, and also run another voting process to make the first steering council election in January 2019. Since then, A new council is elected after each feature release. Each council's term runs from when their election results are finalized until the next council's term starts. There are no term limits. The main duties of the Steering Council are: Maintain the quality and stability of the Python language and CPython interpreter. Make contributing as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible. Formalize and maintain the relationship between the core team and the PSF. Establish appropriate decision-making processes for PEPs. Accept or reject PEPs. Seek consensus among contributors and the core team before acting in a formal capacity. Act as a \"court of final appeal\" for decisions where all other methods have failed. Enforce or update the project's code of conduct. Work with the PSF to manage any project assets. Delegate parts of their authority to other subcommittees or processes. Although the Steering Council is the main governance authority of the Python project there is the core team , the group of trusted volunteers who manage Python, who also make decisions that shape the future of the project . They have authority over the Python Project infrastructure, including the Python Project website itself, the Python GitHub organization and repositories, the bug tracker, the mailing lists, IRC channels, etc. And they also may participate in formal votes, typically to nominate new team members and to elect the steering council. PHP Created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf and originally used for tracking visits to his online resume, he named the suite of scripts \"Personal Home Page Tools,\" more frequently referenced as \"PHP Tools\". In June of 1995 , Rasmus released the source code to the public, which allowed developers to use it and encouraged them to provide fixes for bugs in the code , and to generally improve upon it. After a couple of years and a subsequently various releases, the governance and direction of the project was largely dictated by the simple concept of what has been known in the PHP community as \"karma\" : the more contributions you made to the project the more clout you had when it came to deciding which features made it into a release. From the beginning, PHP was a language born of an itch to scratch. Solutions, rather than concerns over consistency or academic purity, have always been a main goal of the project. But this led to plenty of problems in regards to governance , with the community having to face a crisis related to some feAtures of PHP4. A certain amount of community members started to get the feeling of the project being run by benevolent dictators with commercial interests could have ended with a fork in 2002. After those tense years things have changed significantly. PHP matured both as a language and project, and moved away from the practices of the past and adopted a Request For Comments (RFC) process to govern the discussion of how new features, both ideas and implementations, are brought into the language. The basic steps for getting new code into a PHP release via the RFC process are fairly straightforward today \u2014 the first step is to document the proposal in the RFC section of the PHP wiki, followed by sending an email to the Internals mailing list. The matter is discussed (or not) for a minimum of two weeks, changes made as necessary to the RFC, and ultimately the author of the RFC opens the issue up for a vote or the RFC is withdrawn. If the measure passes, then a new thing in the PHP community is approved. If not, there are opportunities to try again in the future. But who gets to vote, and what constitutes a passing majority are both questions whose answers have caused a little bit of controversy in recent times . Specifically the concept that so many decisions could be made by a simple majority, has been something that has bothered members of the internals community for quite some time and a RFC to remedy it was introduced in 2016, although it wasn't discussed until 2019 when a contributor took issue with other contributors' perceived abuses of the simple majority clause to push certain RFC in their own particular interest (using the simple majority and short voting periods to get quick approval). In the end the RFC to remove simple majorities for future RFCs won adoption , with a clear majority of thirty in favor and two against. In addition to this, a RFC for abolish short period votes was also adopted. As for who has the right to vote on RFCs, PHP only requires a GitHub account and code contributions to the project , with no limitations on when those contributions were made. As a result, language features and procedure changes are generally decided by those who show up to cast their ballot. As an example of how democratic the process is PHP founder Rasmus Lerdorf and other prominent contributors were overruled in a vote of 108 to 48 after heated debate. To sum up, the RFC process has done a great deal to democratize these conflicts and move away from the benevolent dictator approaches of the past, but little to remove the conflicts themselves. One welcome thing it does provide is a clear path for new contributors to make small contributions , such as a single useful function, and succeed in seeing their ideas make it into releases without a great deal of turmoil. For the contributor who is looking to become involved in heavier project decisions however, they will still find it to be at times a discouraging process and should expect to defend their ideas when attempts are made to tear those ideas asunder by more seasoned contributors. Node JS In 2014 some of the core contributors started to push Joyent (main sponsor of Node.js at that time) to move the project into a structure where the contributors and community could step in to solve some of the problems Node was facing : The number of releases of node had been drastically reduced. The number of commits on the Node.js repo had been steadily decreasing. But one of the main reasons was the discontent dissatisfaction over Joyent's stewardship of the Node.js project . As a result four of Node's top 5 contributors forked the project creating io.js . This fork was initialy only as an exploration by some of the key contributors in the Node core community with the following intent: Accelerate release of latest advancements in JavaScript as fast as the community feels necessary. Support an open governance model as against a single corporate stewardship. Joyent responded by forming the Node Advisory Board to set up open governance, but the fork only highlights the tension between corporate sponsor of an open source project and the community of developers contributing to it . After months of pressure, Joyent backed down as steward and handed Node off to a new independent organization, the Node.js Foundation , resulting in Node.js as a whole moving forward much faster and that many of the original contributors returned to work on the same codebase. Then some of the ideas of io.js regarding governance were adopted when merging, leading to an open governance model and Node.js running smoothly . Some of these ideas are briefly described as follow. They started setting up a new vocabulary to clearly identify members of the community : A Contributor is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request. A Committer is a subset of contributors who have been given write access to the repository. A TC (Technical Committee) is a group of committers representing the required technical expertise to resolve rare disputes. Every person who shows up to comment on an issue or submit code is a member of a project's community . Just being able to see them means that they have crossed the line from being a user to being a contributor. They consider that creating barriers to entry just reduces the number of people there's a chance to identify, educate and potentially grow into greater contributors. In addition to this, they explained the so called \"liberal model\" of open governance in their repository documentation. Some of the ideas are: The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that: Encourages new contributions. Encourages contributors to remain involved. Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible. Creates a transparent decision making process which makes it clear how contributors can be involved in decision making. The purpose of this policy is to gain contributors, to retain them as much as possible , and to use a much larger and growing contributor base to manage the corresponding influx of contributions. The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection. During review committers may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a \u201cLGTM\u201d before the PR can be merged. There is no additional \u201csign off\u201d process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by committers are addressed it can be landed by any committer. A key part of the liberal contribution policies they built was an inversion of the typical code review process . Rather than the default mode for a change to be rejected until enough people sign off, they made the default for every change to be integrated . This put the onus on reviewers to note exactly what adjustments need to be made in order for it to be integrated. For new contributors it's a big leap just to get that initial code up and sent. Viewing the code review process as a series of small adjustments and education , rather than a quality control hierarchy, does a lot to encourage and retain these new contributors . In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change. This is what we have seen before as a \"lazy consensus\" seeking process . Most review comments and adjustments are uncontroversial and the process should optimize for getting them in without unnecessary efforts. If a contribution is controversial and committers cannot agree about how to get it to land or if it should land then it should be escalated to the TC. For the minority of changes that are controversial and don't reach an easy consensus they recommend to escalate them to the TC. All contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be on-boarded in a timely manner, and added as a committer, and be given write access to the repository. Not every committer has the rights to release or make high level decisions, so they can be much more liberal about giving out commit rights. That increases the committer base for code review and bug triage. This is the key to scaling contribution growth: committer growth . The TC uses a \u201cconsensus seeking\u201d process for issues that are escalated to the TC. The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among TC members. If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then a majority wins vote is called. It is also expected that the majority of decisions made by the TC are via a consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort. Pure consensus systems incentivize obstructionism which they want to avoid. In pure consensus everyone essentially has a veto. So, if I don\u2019t want something to happen I\u2019m in a strong position of power over everyone that wants something to happen. They have to convince me and I don\u2019t have to convince anyone else of anything. To avoid this they use again the system of \u201cconsensus seeking\u201d which has a long history outside of open source. It's quite simple, just attempt to reach a consensus, if a consensus can't be reached then call for a majority wins vote . Just the fact that a vote is a possibility means that people can't be obstructionists , whether someone favor a change or not, they have to convince their peers and if they aren't willing to put in the work to convince their peers then they probably don't involve themselves in that decision at all. Resolution may involve returning the issue to committers with suggestions on how to move forward towards a consensus. It is not expected that a meeting of the TC will resolve all issues on its agenda during that meeting and may prefer to continue the discussion happening among the committers. They were focused in avoid creating big decision hierarchies . Instead, they bet for investing in a broad, growing and empowered contributorship that can make progress without intervention. Members can be added to the TC at any time. Any committer can nominate another committer to the TC and the TC uses its standard consensus seeking process to evaluate whether or not to add this new member. Members who do not participate consistently at the level of a majority of the other members are expected to resign. As a project grows it's important to add people from a variety of skill sets . If people are doing a lot of docs work, or test work, treat the investment they are making as equally valuable as the hard technical stuff. Defining our Governance Model Open Source projects rarely begin by \"selecting\" and implementing a perfectly preconceived governance model . Much more commonly, projects' governance models evolve as their communities grow and diversify. But it is never too soon to define a suitable governance model . Without one, the chances of third parties wishing to contribute are slightly reduced. This is for a number of reasons: Potential contributors will not know how to contribute. They will not be sure what will happen to their contribution. The project will not look serious about engaging with third parties. There is no visible assurance that contributions will be managed in such a way that they will remain of value to the original contributor. But at the same time, most governance models consist of two primary dimensions: roles, and policies and procedures . The basic requirements here can be evolved as the project grows. There is no need for the first version of the project's governance model to be fully detailed . A framework setting out the starting position is sufficient. Nor does the governance document need to account for every possible future scenario. The idea is to start with a simple and manageable model that will send clear signals to potential contributors . For the sake of transparency, governance documentation (like technical documentation) should explain how things actually work . If there are aspirational goals, those go in their own section under \"Roadmap\" or \"TODO\". In order to be effective, a governance document needs to be concise, accessible and easy to refer to. The main sections of a typical governance document include: Overview . The overview should be short, as the objective is to give people an immediate understanding of what is expected of them if they wish to engage with the project. Roles and responsibilities . Your project could have a variety of real roles, but you only need to define a handful of them to start out. Support . This section documents support processes within the project. For most open source projects, the support channels are the main contact with users of the project, so we have to be sure of providing enough information about how each is used. Decision making process . The efficiency and transparency of the decision making process should be the main focus of this section of the governance document. Contribution process . It details the various types of contribution being sought and the tools available for making and managing those contributions. It should also describe what happens once a contribution has been made by a third party, including details of the process that is followed when a contribution is deemed unsuitable for the project.

It is about defining and managing \"The rules or customs that determine who gets to do what (or is supposed to do what), how they're supposed to do it, and when.\" . In the case of Open Source project and Community Governance is all about people , their rights and responsibilities as part of a project and the expectations others have for them. When analyzing your own governance systems, ask the following questions: What roles do (or can) project contributors play? What qualifies a person to play a particular role in the project? What duties, privileges, and forms of authority are associated with each role? What project resources are the province or responsibility of people who perform certain roles? How do various contributions get accepted into the project? How do contributors come to occupy and eventually depart from certain roles in the project? How can role descriptions and responsibilities be changed? How do project decisions get made (and by whom)? How are debates and conflicts resolved (and by whom)? Because Open Source projects are organizations, every one features governance structures . Some of these structures are more explicit than others. Some are more formal than others. But every project has them.","title":"What is a governance model"},{"location":"define-a-governance-model/#why-governance-model-is-important","text":"Although the idea of \"governance\" could have a poor reputation in some Open Source communities (sometimes viewed as a set of rules or procedures aimed solely at telling people what they can't do, how they shouldn't act, or how they should limit themselves to acting only within certain boundaries), a clear and well-crafted governance model can in fact be a largely positive force, encouraging new contributors to become involved in your project , and is much less likely to turn away or de-motivate project participants than a vague or non-existent one is. So a community's goal in architecting a governance model should be, \"Make structures of participation obvious.\" When your project's rules are clear, contributors can engage with confidence. Taking this approach to governance can positively impact a project's long-term sustainability and growth. Even more, a good governance model will actually increase the agility of the project , as it defines how new contributors can take the project in unexpected directions without interfering with its core goals. It provides a mechanism for allowing the community as a whole to define the direction they feel the project should take , while ensuring that the core project team does not lose control. No matter how an Open Source project is structured. It is always necessary to define some mechanism for deciding how to make technical decisions . Someone, or some group, has to decide which commits to accept, which to reject, and more broadly what direction the project is going to take from a technical perspective. Here's an example of how valuable could be providing information: in 2018, the Kubernetes project Release Team added a set of detailed, comprehensive Role Handbooks , outlining information related to the Release Team role, including qualifications necessary for joining them, duties members of the team perform, and details on the team's decision-making processes. As a result, the Release Team became the most popular point of entry for project contributions , mainly because potential participants knew exactly what to do and expect. After that other teams at Kubernetes followed suit and experienced a doubling or even tripling of the number of new contributors.","title":"Why governance model is important?"},{"location":"define-a-governance-model/#types-of-governance-models","text":"There are many ways to rule an Open Source project, but regardless of which one is chosen, a governance model should make the process of making and evaluating third party contributions easier, not harder . It should remove the uncertainty that can lead to wasted time for everyone involved. It is interesting to note that not all Open Source is truly open . Many Open Source projects are run by a single individual or controlled by a single vendor, and are quite closed in their governance. Other projects are welcoming of outside contributions, but are not open to outside contributors owning leadership roles that let them set technical strategy and direction. Governance models range from centralised control by a single individual or organisation (benevolent dictatorship) to distributed control awarded in recognition of contributions (democray). You can find governance models at any point along this spectrum . In fact, much more commonly, projects' governance models evolve and move along this spectrum as their communities grow and diversify.","title":"Types of governance models"},{"location":"define-a-governance-model/#founder-leader-aka-bdfls-or-benevolent-dictators-for-life","text":"The founder-leader governance model is most common among new projects or those with a small number of contributors (and since most Open Source projects have only a small number of contributors, this is a rather popular model!) In these projects, the individual or group who started the project also administers the project , establishes its vision and roadmap, controls all permissions to merge code into it, and assumes the right to speak for it in public. Some projects refer to their founder-leaders as \"BDFLs\" or \"Benevolent Dictators for Life,\" a term that is falling out of fashion. Although \"Benevolent Dictator\" may sound intimidating at first, it would be better to think of it as \"community-approved arbitrator\" or \"coordinator\". Generally, benevolent dictators do not actually make all the decisions, or even most of the decisions. It's unlikely that one person could have enough expertise to make consistently good decisions across all areas of the project, and anyway, quality developers won't stay around unless they have some influence on the project's direction. Therefore, benevolent dictators commonly do not dictate much . Instead, they let things work themselves out through discussion and experimentation whenever possible. Only when it is clear that no consensus can be reached , and that most of the group wants someone to guide the decision so that development can move on, does she put her foot down and say \"This is the way it's going to be\" .","title":"Founder-leader (aka \"BDFLs\" or \"Benevolent Dictators for Life\")"},{"location":"define-a-governance-model/#consensus-based-democracy","text":"As projects get older, they tend to move away from the benevolent dictatorship model and toward more openly democratic systems , as \"Do-ocracy\" or \"Meritocracy\" (although this term carries negative connotations for some communities and has a complex social and political history).

It is not an ambiguous state: a group has reached consensus on a given question when someone proposes that consensus has been reached and no one contradicts the assertion.

This is sometimes referred to as \"meritocracy\", and this functions well for most cases. In addition, the meritocratic model tries to give everyone a voice and reward those who make valuable contributions by providing mechanisms for recognition, such as increased visibility within the project. As with the benevolent dictator model, decisions are made by listening to the community and eventually taking action based on the consensus that emerges. However, in many cases there is no need for discussion, since the correct path is obvious. In this case, it is sufficient to simply state one's intentions and allow time for someone to object. In the absence of an objection, it is assumed that the community agrees with the proposed action. This is sometimes called \"lazy consensus\" . The effect of lazy consensus means that, in practice, most decisions within a meritocracy are made in a way that is very similar to that of projects operating under a benevolent dictator model . That is, once someone has earned the merit to allow them to define a course of action, the use of lazy consensus allows them to just go ahead and take whatever action they want. Just as a benevolent dictator could do. Inevitably, some debates just won't consense. When all other means of breaking a deadlock fail, the solution is to vote . But before a vote can be taken, there must be a clear set of choices on the ballot. It is important to note the controversial of the term \"merit\" , usually described as having the necessary ability or experience to do the job. However, meritocracies tend to promote those who not only have the skills/experience, but also the opportunity or possibility to let others know about it, priviledges that not everyone has to the same extent.","title":"Meritocracy.

That said it's interesting to note that a particular governance style doesn't automatically imply a particular contribution model , although projects do tend to start as cathedral-style (a small core of dedicated contributions) benevolent dictatorships and move towards bazaar-style (contributions from broad sources) contribution or meritocratic-style governance (or both) as they mature.","title":"Do-ocracy.

In the same way some open source projects choose to conduct governance through elections . They may hold elections for various roles, or conduct similar electoral processes to ratify or update project policies and procedures. Under the electoral model, communities establish and document electoral procedures to which they all agree, then enact those procedures as a regular matter of decision-making.

They can trust that their contributions will be accepted based on what they do and what's best for the project, not what's best for a particular company. The reality is that open technology projects managed under Open Governance (the sort of Open Governance found in organizations such as Apache, Eclipse, Mozilla, and Linux) are demonstrably more successful (by an order of magnitude), have a longer life, and are less risky than projects that are controlled by a single vendor or are more restrictive in their governance.","title":"About Open Governance"},{"location":"define-a-governance-model/#some-examples-of-governance-through-popular-open-source-projects","text":"","title":"Some examples of governance through popular open source projects"},{"location":"define-a-governance-model/#apache-foundation-projects","text":"Apache foundation was created in 1999 by a group of people, that called themselves the \"Apache Group\" to continue to support and maintain the HTTPD web server written by the NCSA.

On that date he decided to remove himself entirely from the decision process, and delegate to the community the responsibility of taking decisions, starting with defining the way they wanted to take future decisions and define a new governance model. They use the PEPs formula to ask the community about the way they wanted to organise from that moment on, having different proposals: The Technical Leader Governance Model -- PEP 8010 . This PEP proposes a continuation of the singular technical project leader model , euphemistically called the Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) model of Python governance, to be henceforth called in this PEP the Gracious Umpire Influencing Decisions Officer (GUIDO). Python Governance Model Lead by Trio of Pythonistas -- PEP 8011 . This PEP proposes a governance model for the Core Python development community, led by a trio of equally authoritative leaders . The Trio of Pythonistas (ToP, or simply Trio) is tasked with making final decisions for the language. It differs from PEP 8010 by specifically not proposing a central singular leader, but instead a group of three people as the leaders . The Community Governance Model -- PEP 8012 This PEP proposes a new model of Python governance based on consensus and voting by the Python community . This model relies on workgroups to carry out the governance of the Python language. This governance model works without the role of a centralized singular leader or a governing council. The External Council Governance Model -- PEP 8013 This PEP proposes a new model of Python governance based on a Council of Auditors (CoA) tasked with making final decisions for the language. It differs from PEP 8010 by specifically not proposing a central singular leader , and from PEP 8011 by disallowing core committers from being council members . It describes the size and role of the council, how the initial group of council members will be chosen, any term limits of the council members, and how successors will be elected. The Commons Governance Model -- PEP 8014 This PEP proposes a governance model with as few procedures, defined terms and percentages as possible . It may also be called The Anarchist Governance Model but uses Commons for now because of possible negative connotations of the term Anarchist to some audiences. Organization of the Python community -- PEP 8015 . This PEP formalizes the current organization of the Python community and proposes 3 main changes : formalize the existing concept of \"Python teams\" ; give more autonomy to Python teams ; replace the BDFL (Guido van Rossum) with a new \"Python board\" of 3 members which has limited roles, mostly decide how a PEP is approved (or rejected).

The council has broad authority, which they seek to exercise as rarely as possible; instead, they use this power to establish standard processes , like those proposed in the other 801x-series PEPs. To let community decide they set a private poll (using CIVS, a free Internet voting service) available for 2-week-long window on December 2018. Every committer received an email with a link allowing them to rank the proposals in their order of preference . The results of the election, including anonymized ballots, were public on December 17th, after the election ended. The whole details on the voting process were very well described in a PEP created for this specific purpose, and probably was the first community-wide decision they had to take. After the election completed the result was that PEP 8016: The Steering Council Model was selected as the winner . Then they defined the formal goverance process for Python around the steering council (a 5-person committee), which has broad authority but seek to exercise as rarely as possible, and also run another voting process to make the first steering council election in January 2019. Since then, A new council is elected after each feature release. Each council's term runs from when their election results are finalized until the next council's term starts. There are no term limits. The main duties of the Steering Council are: Maintain the quality and stability of the Python language and CPython interpreter. Make contributing as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible. Formalize and maintain the relationship between the core team and the PSF. Establish appropriate decision-making processes for PEPs. Accept or reject PEPs. Seek consensus among contributors and the core team before acting in a formal capacity. Act as a \"court of final appeal\" for decisions where all other methods have failed. Enforce or update the project's code of conduct. Work with the PSF to manage any project assets. Delegate parts of their authority to other subcommittees or processes. Although the Steering Council is the main governance authority of the Python project there is the core team , the group of trusted volunteers who manage Python, who also make decisions that shape the future of the project . They have authority over the Python Project infrastructure, including the Python Project website itself, the Python GitHub organization and repositories, the bug tracker, the mailing lists, IRC channels, etc. And they also may participate in formal votes, typically to nominate new team members and to elect the steering council.","title":"Python"},{"location":"define-a-governance-model/#php","text":"Created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf and originally used for tracking visits to his online resume, he named the suite of scripts \"Personal Home Page Tools,\" more frequently referenced as \"PHP Tools\". In June of 1995 , Rasmus released the source code to the public, which allowed developers to use it and encouraged them to provide fixes for bugs in the code , and to generally improve upon it. After a couple of years and a subsequently various releases, the governance and direction of the project was largely dictated by the simple concept of what has been known in the PHP community as \"karma\" : the more contributions you made to the project the more clout you had when it came to deciding which features made it into a release. From the beginning, PHP was a language born of an itch to scratch. Solutions, rather than concerns over consistency or academic purity, have always been a main goal of the project. But this led to plenty of problems in regards to governance , with the community having to face a crisis related to some feAtures of PHP4. A certain amount of community members started to get the feeling of the project being run by benevolent dictators with commercial interests could have ended with a fork in 2002. After those tense years things have changed significantly. PHP matured both as a language and project, and moved away from the practices of the past and adopted a Request For Comments (RFC) process to govern the discussion of how new features, both ideas and implementations, are brought into the language. The basic steps for getting new code into a PHP release via the RFC process are fairly straightforward today \u2014 the first step is to document the proposal in the RFC section of the PHP wiki, followed by sending an email to the Internals mailing list. The matter is discussed (or not) for a minimum of two weeks, changes made as necessary to the RFC, and ultimately the author of the RFC opens the issue up for a vote or the RFC is withdrawn. If the measure passes, then a new thing in the PHP community is approved. If not, there are opportunities to try again in the future. But who gets to vote, and what constitutes a passing majority are both questions whose answers have caused a little bit of controversy in recent times . Specifically the concept that so many decisions could be made by a simple majority, has been something that has bothered members of the internals community for quite some time and a RFC to remedy it was introduced in 2016, although it wasn't discussed until 2019 when a contributor took issue with other contributors' perceived abuses of the simple majority clause to push certain RFC in their own particular interest (using the simple majority and short voting periods to get quick approval). In the end the RFC to remove simple majorities for future RFCs won adoption , with a clear majority of thirty in favor and two against. In addition to this, a RFC for abolish short period votes was also adopted. As for who has the right to vote on RFCs, PHP only requires a GitHub account and code contributions to the project , with no limitations on when those contributions were made. As a result, language features and procedure changes are generally decided by those who show up to cast their ballot. As an example of how democratic the process is PHP founder Rasmus Lerdorf and other prominent contributors were overruled in a vote of 108 to 48 after heated debate. To sum up, the RFC process has done a great deal to democratize these conflicts and move away from the benevolent dictator approaches of the past, but little to remove the conflicts themselves. One welcome thing it does provide is a clear path for new contributors to make small contributions , such as a single useful function, and succeed in seeing their ideas make it into releases without a great deal of turmoil. For the contributor who is looking to become involved in heavier project decisions however, they will still find it to be at times a discouraging process and should expect to defend their ideas when attempts are made to tear those ideas asunder by more seasoned contributors.","title":"PHP"},{"location":"define-a-governance-model/#node-js","text":"In 2014 some of the core contributors started to push Joyent (main sponsor of Node.js at that time) to move the project into a structure where the contributors and community could step in to solve some of the problems Node was facing : The number of releases of node had been drastically reduced. The number of commits on the Node.js repo had been steadily decreasing. But one of the main reasons was the discontent dissatisfaction over Joyent's stewardship of the Node.js project . As a result four of Node's top 5 contributors forked the project creating io.js . This fork was initialy only as an exploration by some of the key contributors in the Node core community with the following intent: Accelerate release of latest advancements in JavaScript as fast as the community feels necessary. Support an open governance model as against a single corporate stewardship. Joyent responded by forming the Node Advisory Board to set up open governance, but the fork only highlights the tension between corporate sponsor of an open source project and the community of developers contributing to it . After months of pressure, Joyent backed down as steward and handed Node off to a new independent organization, the Node.js Foundation , resulting in Node.js as a whole moving forward much faster and that many of the original contributors returned to work on the same codebase. Then some of the ideas of io.js regarding governance were adopted when merging, leading to an open governance model and Node.js running smoothly . Some of these ideas are briefly described as follow. They started setting up a new vocabulary to clearly identify members of the community : A Contributor is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request. A Committer is a subset of contributors who have been given write access to the repository. A TC (Technical Committee) is a group of committers representing the required technical expertise to resolve rare disputes. Every person who shows up to comment on an issue or submit code is a member of a project's community . Just being able to see them means that they have crossed the line from being a user to being a contributor. They consider that creating barriers to entry just reduces the number of people there's a chance to identify, educate and potentially grow into greater contributors. In addition to this, they explained the so called \"liberal model\" of open governance in their repository documentation. Some of the ideas are: The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that: Encourages new contributions. Encourages contributors to remain involved. Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible. Creates a transparent decision making process which makes it clear how contributors can be involved in decision making. The purpose of this policy is to gain contributors, to retain them as much as possible , and to use a much larger and growing contributor base to manage the corresponding influx of contributions. The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection. During review committers may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a \u201cLGTM\u201d before the PR can be merged. There is no additional \u201csign off\u201d process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by committers are addressed it can be landed by any committer. A key part of the liberal contribution policies they built was an inversion of the typical code review process . Rather than the default mode for a change to be rejected until enough people sign off, they made the default for every change to be integrated . This put the onus on reviewers to note exactly what adjustments need to be made in order for it to be integrated. For new contributors it's a big leap just to get that initial code up and sent. Viewing the code review process as a series of small adjustments and education , rather than a quality control hierarchy, does a lot to encourage and retain these new contributors . In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change. This is what we have seen before as a \"lazy consensus\" seeking process . Most review comments and adjustments are uncontroversial and the process should optimize for getting them in without unnecessary efforts. If a contribution is controversial and committers cannot agree about how to get it to land or if it should land then it should be escalated to the TC. For the minority of changes that are controversial and don't reach an easy consensus they recommend to escalate them to the TC. All contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be on-boarded in a timely manner, and added as a committer, and be given write access to the repository. Not every committer has the rights to release or make high level decisions, so they can be much more liberal about giving out commit rights. That increases the committer base for code review and bug triage. This is the key to scaling contribution growth: committer growth . The TC uses a \u201cconsensus seeking\u201d process for issues that are escalated to the TC. The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among TC members. If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then a majority wins vote is called. It is also expected that the majority of decisions made by the TC are via a consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort. Pure consensus systems incentivize obstructionism which they want to avoid. In pure consensus everyone essentially has a veto. So, if I don\u2019t want something to happen I\u2019m in a strong position of power over everyone that wants something to happen. They have to convince me and I don\u2019t have to convince anyone else of anything. To avoid this they use again the system of \u201cconsensus seeking\u201d which has a long history outside of open source. It's quite simple, just attempt to reach a consensus, if a consensus can't be reached then call for a majority wins vote . Just the fact that a vote is a possibility means that people can't be obstructionists , whether someone favor a change or not, they have to convince their peers and if they aren't willing to put in the work to convince their peers then they probably don't involve themselves in that decision at all. Resolution may involve returning the issue to committers with suggestions on how to move forward towards a consensus. It is not expected that a meeting of the TC will resolve all issues on its agenda during that meeting and may prefer to continue the discussion happening among the committers. They were focused in avoid creating big decision hierarchies . Instead, they bet for investing in a broad, growing and empowered contributorship that can make progress without intervention. Members can be added to the TC at any time. Any committer can nominate another committer to the TC and the TC uses its standard consensus seeking process to evaluate whether or not to add this new member. Members who do not participate consistently at the level of a majority of the other members are expected to resign. As a project grows it's important to add people from a variety of skill sets . If people are doing a lot of docs work, or test work, treat the investment they are making as equally valuable as the hard technical stuff.","title":"Node JS"},{"location":"define-a-governance-model/#defining-our-governance-model","text":"Open Source projects rarely begin by \"selecting\" and implementing a perfectly preconceived governance model . Much more commonly, projects' governance models evolve as their communities grow and diversify. But it is never too soon to define a suitable governance model . Without one, the chances of third parties wishing to contribute are slightly reduced. This is for a number of reasons: Potential contributors will not know how to contribute. They will not be sure what will happen to their contribution. The project will not look serious about engaging with third parties. There is no visible assurance that contributions will be managed in such a way that they will remain of value to the original contributor. But at the same time, most governance models consist of two primary dimensions: roles, and policies and procedures . The basic requirements here can be evolved as the project grows. There is no need for the first version of the project's governance model to be fully detailed . A framework setting out the starting position is sufficient. Nor does the governance document need to account for every possible future scenario. The idea is to start with a simple and manageable model that will send clear signals to potential contributors . For the sake of transparency, governance documentation (like technical documentation) should explain how things actually work . If there are aspirational goals, those go in their own section under \"Roadmap\" or \"TODO\". In order to be effective, a governance document needs to be concise, accessible and easy to refer to. The main sections of a typical governance document include: Overview . The overview should be short, as the objective is to give people an immediate understanding of what is expected of them if they wish to engage with the project. Roles and responsibilities . Your project could have a variety of real roles, but you only need to define a handful of them to start out. Support . This section documents support processes within the project. For most open source projects, the support channels are the main contact with users of the project, so we have to be sure of providing enough information about how each is used. Decision making process . The efficiency and transparency of the decision making process should be the main focus of this section of the governance document. Contribution process . It details the various types of contribution being sought and the tools available for making and managing those contributions. It should also describe what happens once a contribution has been made by a third party, including details of the process that is followed when a contribution is deemed unsuitable for the project.","title":"Defining our Governance Model"},{"location":"define-a-governance-model/#sources","text":"Projects that make their rules explicit would see more participation Leadership and Governance Meritocracy https://geekfeminismdotorg.wordpress.com/2009/11/29/questioning-the-merit-of-meritocracy/ Community-Led development \"The Apache Way - How it works\" Community-Led development \"The Apache Way\" - Voting Guido van Rossum on mailing list [python-committers] Transfer of power Python Language Governance Proposal Overview -- PEP 8000 Python Governance Voting Process -- PEP 8001 Python governance vote (December 2018): Results CIVS Condorcet Internet Voting Service Python Language Governance -- PEP 13 Python January 2019 steering council election -- PEP 8100 History of PHP The history and evolution of PHP governance PHP RFC: Abolish Narrow Margins PHP RFC: Abolish Short Votes Request for Comments: Voting on PHP features Healthy Open Source Level projects basic contributing definition io.js Project Governance io.js and a node.js Foundation Node.js vs io.js: Why the fork?!?

The proposed elements are assumptions that will need to be validated and which have been made upon the previous research done on this topic by our team. For the current proposed business model, the following considerations have been considered: Project License & Philosophy Current state of the software Current objectives of the project Available resource limitations License & Philosophy One of the main objectives of the project is to make our solution available to all and have people contribute and evolve it for the benefit of everyone who wants to use it. MPL Licensing options grants the possibility to also use the code and expand it clearly differentiating the proprietary code from the free open-source code. We want the project to become a relevant and useful tool for our users so that we will add new features based upon cumulative future requests and inquiries or financial support received for specific purposes. If you want to make money using Boken Engine you can do so and should not be hampered in doing this, leaving the door open to different options for the creation of additional paid and unpaid features by the Boken Team and other developers. Current state of the software The Boken Engine software now (2021 March) does not have any visual user interface and requires both for install and productive use development skills, which excludes non developers from using it on their own. The current proposed business model reflects this fact and is built upon this underlying condition. Current objectives of the project The current objective for us is to make advertise and make our project known to the public be they developers or end users. To incentivize developers to contribute and use the Boken Engine. To capture the attention and display the potential of this solution. To further develop its features and usability. To cover costs. To test the different elements of the business model. To create a beautiful Demo that will display all the current potential of Boken Engine. Proposed Business Model The proposed business model is a combination of the researched business models and an idea of crowdsourcing funds through the creation of our own demo apps as a form to create and display the potential of our tool. The two main business models that we believe can be employed are the standard Support Service Model and the Related Services or Products model which are feasible with the chosen MPL license. For the model to cover costs at first, and in the future to become profitable to further explore and expand it, it is essential to keep it as open as possible and that we make high quality examples of what can be achieved with our solution to incentivize adoption. Each of the elements will be explained in more detail below. Customer Segments These are the initial customer groups that we can aim at given the state of the software and based upon the services and products that we can deliver right now with a reasonable effort and considering our own available resources. Customer relationships The relationships with contributors and the users that we can currently address through the different platforms that are either already set up or can be set up. GITHUB community a related forum and a website or blog of the project to keep people updated on the progress. Initially the effort will be minimal except for the technical setup of the various elements in this section. At a later stage when more people join the effort will increase, for instance the Project Community of contributors etc. will have to be daily, a blog letter should if possible be weekly. On the other hand, if we are to run a Kickstarter Campaign, we will have to prepare to interact daily to take care of followers and buyers. Channels These are the points of contact with potential customers and contributors. We believe that the main channels are going to be digital and online, most of them being free and with no monetary cost except for the time we will have to dedicate to this task. The ones that we believe will be free are marked in light Green. The Demo app can be seen as a channel two since it will help us reach customers through branding it and including links to our website, Github etc. The requirement of time for this app we estimate it to be 40 MDs. Depending on whether we decide to launch a Kickstarter Campaign this has the potential to be sales and promotion channel for the project that could reach End Users of this type of final apps. Key propositions - Value Creation These are the main benefits of using Boken Engine for the different customer Groups and the services that will be provided. For better understanding we have divided them in areas: Source Code Related License Related Community Related Key Activities The relevant activities to engage to make the model work are the tasks or things that we need to engage with and accomplish. Here we believe that it is going to be, such as developing Boken Engine more, develop support material such as video tutorials, documentation, basic marketing, through the mentioned channels. Key Resources These are the elements that are essential to our activities, our experts the community and design resources for any app that we will make, and which will have to be found. Key Partners To gain competitive advantage we heavily rely on our success to create a large community of contributors and users, in addition to sufficient adoption of Boken Engine so that independent software developers start to adopt it for work related issues. Cost Structure This section reflects the approximate costs in time that we expect to have during the coming three 4 months, and the cost streams, our own in-house developers, etc. Also, I have indicated the possibility of a marketing budget, depending on the internal funds that we will get access to. Revenue Streams For the coming 4 months no revenues are expected. The intention and main goals are to create a steady flow of revenues to support the continuing growth of Boken Engine. The main volume if we adhere to this business model and gain traction will come mostly from support services such as consulting, custom developments, support and documentation. As a second potential stream we think that it is interesting to explore Kickstarter crowdsourcing. If we are able to launch and successfully run a Kickstarter campaign to promote our own apps we could expect a certain amount of revenues also from this source. We believe that a Kickstarter Campaign for the creation of the High-Quality Demo App is a way that we can explore since it can help us meet several goals at once: Create publicity for the project over the Kickstarter Campaign period. Display the potential of the potential of the Boken Engine. Market research as to the features that end users, the consumers of apps made with Boken Engine would like to see and value. Create revenues to continue our work Boken Engine and grow our community. Future evolution of the software and business model The future evolution and roadmap of the software will shape the additional elements that will be included in the business model. For instance, if the project improves its usability and ease of installation in the future End Users will not require any development skills to install and use the Boken Engine. This for example would open additional possibilities to expand the number of potential users and help its adoption and growth. Also, no business model is fixed in stone, it is an evolutionary system which evolves to serve the needs of customers and also adapt to market conditions; therefore, it is always open to change.","title":"BOKEN ENGINE \u2013 Proposed Business Model"},{"location":"sample_conclusions/BOKEN_ENGINE_%E2%80%93_Proposed_Business_Model/#boken-engine-proposed-business-model","text":"","title":"BOKEN ENGINE \u2013 Proposed Business Model"},{"location":"sample_conclusions/BOKEN_ENGINE_%E2%80%93_Proposed_Business_Model/#objective-of-the-proposed-business-model-canvas","text":"The objective of the proposed canvas is to reflect what is possible and what elements are relevant to be considered in this model.

That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the benevolent dictator. In case of disagreement, they have the last word. It is the benevolent dictator\u2019s job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community\u2019s job to guide the decisions of the benevolent dictator through active engagement and contribution. Roles And Responsibilities Benevolent dictator (project lead) Typically, the benevolent dictator, or project lead, is self-appointed. However, because the community always has the ability to fork, this person is fully answerable to the community. The project lead\u2019s role is a difficult one: they set the strategic objectives of the project and communicate these clearly to the community. They also have to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, while ensuring that the project survives in the long term. In many ways, the role of the benevolent dictator is less about dictatorship and more about diplomacy. The key is to ensure that, as the project expands, the right people are given influence over it and the community rallies behind the vision of the project lead. The lead\u2019s job is then to ensure that the committers (see below) make the right decisions on behalf of the project. Generally speaking, as long as the committers are aligned with the project\u2019s strategy, the project lead will allow them to proceed as they desire. Committers Committers are contributors who have made several valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. In many cases they are programmers but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role. Typically, a committer will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project lead. The role of committer is not an official one, it is simply a position that influential members of the community will find themselves in as the project lead looks to them for guidance and support. Committers have no authority over the overall direction of the project. However, they do have the ear of the project lead. It is a committer\u2019s job to ensure that the lead is aware of the community\u2019s needs and collective objectives, and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. Often, committers are given informal control over their specific areas of responsibility, and are assigned rights to directly modify certain areas of the source code. That is, although committers do not have explicit decision-making authority, they will often find that their actions are synonymous with the decisions made by the lead. Contributors Contributors are community members who either have no desire to become committers, or have not yet been given the opportunity by the benevolent dictator. They make valuable contributions, such as those outlined in the list below, but generally do not have the authority to make direct changes to the project code. [TBD] Contributors engage with the project through communication tools ~~, such as email lists, and via reports and patches attached to issues in the issue tracker~~. Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project. Some contributors will already be engaging with the project as users, but will also find themselves doing one or more of the following: supporting new users (current users often provide the most effective new user support) reporting bugs identifying requirements supplying graphics and web design programming assisting with project infrastructure writing documentation fixing bugs adding features As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, they may find that the project lead starts relying on them more and more. When this begins to happen, they gradually adopt the role of committer, as described above. Users Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements. Users should be encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible.

Common user activities include (but are not limited to): evangelising about the project informing developers of project strengths and weaknesses from a new user\u2019s perspective providing moral support (a \u2018thank you\u2019 goes a long way) providing financial support Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become contributors, as described above. Support All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new users within the project management infrastructure. This support is provided as a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognise that all support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as and when time allows. A user requiring guaranteed response times or results should therefore seek to purchase a support contract from a vendor. (Of course, that vendor should be an active member of the community.) However, for those willing to engage with the project on its own terms, and willing to help support other users, the community support channels are ideal.

Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project community. Roles And Responsibilities Users Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community and without them the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements. The project asks its users to participate in the project and community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. User's Tasks Common user contributions include (but are not limited to): evangelising about the project (e.g. a link on a website and word-of-mouth awareness raising) informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective providing moral support (a 'thank you' goes a long way) providing financial support (the software is open source, but its developers need to eat) Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often become more and more involved. Such users may find themselves becoming contributors, as described in the next section. Contributors Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. Contributors' Tasks In addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find themselves doing one or more of the following: supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to support new users) reporting bugs identifying requirements providing graphics and web design programming assisting with project infrastructure writing documentation fixing bugs adding features Contributors engage with the project through the issue tracker on GitHub [TBD] ~~and mailing list~~, creating or commenting on an issue or pull request, or by writing or editing documentation. They submit changes to the project itself via pull requests, which will be considered for inclusion in the project by existing committers (see next section). [TBD] ~~The developer mailing list is the most appropriate place to ask for help when making that first contribution.~~ As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their profile within, and commitment to, the community will increase. At some stage, they may find themselves being nominated for committership. Committers Committers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the community. Committership allows contributors to more easily carry on with their project related activities by giving them direct access to the project\u2019s resources (e.g. write access to the repository). That is, they can make changes directly to project outputs, without having to submit changes via patches. This does not mean that a committer is free to do what they want. In fact, committers have no more authority over the project than contributors. While committership indicates a valued member of the community who has demonstrated a healthy respect for the project\u2019s aims and objectives, their work continues to be reviewed by the community before acceptance in an official release. The key difference between a committer and a contributor is when this approval is sought from the community. A committer seeks approval after the contribution is made, rather than before. Seeking approval after making a contribution is known as a commit-then-review process. It is more efficient to allow trusted people to make direct contributions, as the majority of those contributions will be accepted by the project. The project employs various communication mechanisms to ensure that all contributions are reviewed by the community as a whole. By the time a contributor is invited to become a committer, they will have become familiar with the project\u2019s various tools as a user and then as a contributor. Anyone can become a committer; there are no special requirements, other than to have shown a willingness and ability to participate in the project as a team player. Typically, a potential committer will need to show that they have an understanding of the project, its objectives and its strategy. They will also have provided valuable contributions to the project over a period of time. How to become a commiter New committers can be nominated by any existing committer. Once they have been nominated, there will be a vote by the project management committee (PMC; see below). [TBD] ~~Committer voting is one of the few activities that takes place on the project\u2019s private management list~~. This is to allow PMC members to freely express their opinions about a nominee without causing embarrassment. Once the vote has been held, the aggregated voting results are published [TBD] ~~on the public mailing list~~. The nominee is entitled to request an explanation of any \u2018no\u2019 votes against them, regardless of the outcome of the vote. This explanation will be provided by the PMC Chair (see below) and will be anonymous and constructive in nature. Nominees may decline their appointment as a committer. However, this is unusual, as the project does not expect any specific time or resource commitment from its community members. The intention behind the role of committer is to allow people to contribute to the project more easily, not to tie them in to the project in any formal way. It is important to recognise that commitership is a privilege, not a right. That privilege must be earned and once earned it can be removed by the PMC (see next section) in extreme circumstances. However, under normal circumstances committership exists for as long as the committer wishes to continue engaging with the project. A committer who shows an above-average level of contribution to the project, particularly with respect to its strategic direction and long-term health, may be nominated to become a member of the PMC. This role is described below. Project management committee The project management committee consists of those individuals identified as \u2018project owners\u2019 on the development site. The PMC has additional responsibilities over and above those of a committer. These responsibilities ensure the smooth running of the project. PMC members are expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the governance model and manage the copyrights within the project outputs. Members of the PMC do not have significant authority over other members of the community, although it is the PMC that votes on new committers. It also makes decisions when community consensus cannot be reached. [TBD] ~~In addition, the PMC has access to the project\u2019s private mailing list and its archives. This list is used for sensitive issues, such as votes for new committers and legal matters that cannot be discussed in public. It is never used for project management or planning.~~ Membership of the PMC is by invitation from the existing PMC members. A nomination will result in discussion and then a vote by the existing PMC members. PMC membership votes are subject to consensus approval of the current PMC members. Support All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new users within the project management infrastructure. This support is provided as a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognise that all support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as and when time allows. A user requiring guaranteed response times or results should therefore seek to purchase a support contract from a community member. However, for those willing to engage with the project on its own terms, and willing to help support other users, the community support channels are ideal. Contribution Process Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are many ways to contribute. For instance, a contributor might be active on the [TBD] ~~project mailing list and~~ issue tracker, or might supply patches. The various ways of contributing are described in more detail in CONTRIBUTING . The [TBD] ~~developer mailing list~~ Discussions section of the Boken Engine GitHub repository is the most appropriate place for a contributor to ask for help when making their first contribution. Decision Making Process Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all members of the community, from the newest user to the most experienced PMC member. ~~All non-sensitive project management discussion takes place on the project contributors\u2019 mailing list. Occasionally, sensitive discussion occurs on a private list.~~ [TBD] In order to ensure that the project is not bogged down by endless discussion and continual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy consensus. This allows the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote. Lazy consensus Decision making typically involves the following steps: Proposal Discussion Vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion) Decision Any community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community. In order to initiate a discussion about a new idea, they should [TBD] ~~send an email to the project contributors\u2019 list~~ start a discussion on the Boken Engine GitHub repository or submit a patch implementing the idea to the issue tracker. This will prompt a review and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this review and discussion is to gain approval for the contribution. Since most people in the project community have a shared vision, there is often little need for discussion in order to reach consensus. In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is recognised as having the support of the community. This is called lazy consensus - that is, those who have not stated their opinion explicitly have implicitly agreed to the implementation of the proposal. Lazy consensus is a very important concept within the project. It is this process that allows a large group of people to efficiently reach consensus, as someone with no objections to a proposal need not spend time stating their position, and others need not spend time reading such mails. For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least [TBD] 72 hours before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the proposal. This time period is chosen so as to be as inclusive as possible of all participants, regardless of their location and time commitments. Voting Not all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. Issues such as those affecting the strategic direction or legal standing of the project must gain explicit approval in the form of a vote. Every member of the community is encouraged to express their opinions in all discussion and all votes. However, only project committers and/or PMC members (as defined above) have binding votes for the purposes of decision making. The following is a more detailed description of how voting is conducted in projects following the practice established within the Apache Software Foundation. [TBD] If a formal vote on a proposal is called (signaled simply by sending a email with \u2018[VOTE]\u2019 in the subject line), all participants on the project contributors\u2019 list may express an opinion and vote. They do this by sending an email in reply to the original \u2018[VOTE]\u2019 email, with the following vote and information: +1 \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018agree\u2019: also willing to help bring about the proposed action +0 \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018agree\u2019: not willing or able to help bring about the proposed action -0 \u2018no\u2019, \u2018disagree\u2019: but will not oppose the action\u2019s going forward -1 \u2018no\u2019, \u2018disagree\u2019: opposes the action\u2019s going forward and must propose an alternative action to address the issue (or a justification for not addressing the issue) To abstain from the vote, participants simply do not respond ~~to the email~~. However, it can be more helpful to cast a \u2018+0\u2019 or \u2018-0\u2019 than to abstain, since this allows the team to gauge the general feeling of the community if the proposal should be controversial. Every member of the community, from interested user to the most active developer, has a vote. The project encourages all members to express their opinions in all discussion and all votes. However, only some members have binding votes for the purposes of decision making; for example in the Apache Software Foundation these are the committers and/or the members of the Project Management Committee. It is therefore their responsibility to ensure that the opinions of all community members are considered. While not all members may have a binding vote, a well-justified \u2018-1\u2019 from a non-committer must be considered by the community, and if appropriate, supported by a binding \u2018-1\u2019. A \u2018-1\u2019 can also indicate a veto, depending on the type of vote and who is using it. Someone without a binding vote cannot veto a proposal, so in their case a -1 would simply indicate an objection. When a [VOTE] receives a \u2018-1\u2019, it is the responsibility of the community as a whole to address the objection. Such discussion will continue until the objection is either rescinded, overruled (in the case of a non-binding veto) or the proposal itself is altered in order to achieve consensus (possibly by withdrawing it altogether). In the rare circumstance that consensus cannot be achieved, the PMC will decide the forward course of action. In summary: - Those who don\u2019t agree with the proposal and think they have a better idea should vote -1 and defend their counter-proposal. - Those who don\u2019t agree but don\u2019t have a better idea should vote -0. - Those who agree but will not actively assist in implementing the proposal should vote +0. - Those who agree and will actively assist in implementing the proposal should vote +1. Types Of Approval Different actions require different types of approval, ranging from lazy consensus to a majority decision by the PMC. These are summarised in the table below. The section after the table describes which type of approval should be used in common situations. [TBD] Type Description Duration Lazy consensus An action with lazy consensus is implicitly allowed, unless a binding -1 vote is received. Depending on the type of action, a vote will then be called. Note that even though a binding -1 is required to prevent the action, all community members are encouraged to cast a -1 vote with supporting argument. Committers are expected to evaluate the argument and, if necessary, support it with a binding -1. N/A Lazy majority A lazy majority vote requires more binding +1 votes than binding -1 votes. [TBD] ~~72~~ hours Consensus approval Consensus approval requires three binding +1 votes and no binding -1 votes. [TBD] ~~72~~ hours Unanimous consensus All of the binding votes that are cast are to be +1 and there can be no binding vetoes (-1). [TBD] ~~120~~ hours 2/3 majority Some strategic actions require a 2/3 majority of PMC members; in addition, 2/3 of the binding votes cast must be +1. Such actions typically affect the foundation of the project (e.g. adopting a new codebase to replace an existing product). [TBD] ~~120~~ hours When Is A Vote Required? Every effort is made to allow the majority of decisions to be taken through lazy consensus. That is, simply stating one\u2019s intentions is assumed to be enough to proceed, unless an objection is raised. However, some activities require a more formal approval process in order to ensure fully transparent decision making. The table below describes some of the actions that will require a vote. It also identifies which type of vote should be called. Action Description Approval type Release plan Defines the timetable and actions for a release. A release plan cannot be vetoed (hence lazy majority). Lazy majority Product release When a release of one of the project\u2019s products is ready, a vote is required to accept the release as an official release of the project. A release cannot be vetoed (hence lazy majority). Lazy majority New committer A new committer has been proposed. Consensus approval of the PMC New PMC member A new PMC member has been proposed. Consensus approval of the community Committer removal When removal of commit privileges is sought. Unanimous consensus of the PMC PMC member removal When removal of PMC membership is sought.

Committership allows contributors to more easily carry on with their project related activities by giving them direct access to the project\u2019s resources (e.g. write access to the repository). That is, they can make changes directly to project outputs, without having to submit changes via patches. This does not mean that a committer is free to do what they want. In fact, committers have no more authority over the project than contributors. While committership indicates a valued member of the community who has demonstrated a healthy respect for the project\u2019s aims and objectives, their work continues to be reviewed by the community before acceptance in an official release. The key difference between a committer and a contributor is when this approval is sought from the community. A committer seeks approval after the contribution is made, rather than before. Seeking approval after making a contribution is known as a commit-then-review process. It is more efficient to allow trusted people to make direct contributions, as the majority of those contributions will be accepted by the project. The project employs various communication mechanisms to ensure that all contributions are reviewed by the community as a whole. By the time a contributor is invited to become a committer, they will have become familiar with the project\u2019s various tools as a user and then as a contributor. Anyone can become a committer; there are no special requirements, other than to have shown a willingness and ability to participate in the project as a team player.

The intention behind the role of committer is to allow people to contribute to the project more easily, not to tie them in to the project in any formal way. It is important to recognise that commitership is a privilege, not a right. That privilege must be earned and once earned it can be removed by the PMC (see next section) in extreme circumstances. However, under normal circumstances committership exists for as long as the committer wishes to continue engaging with the project.

In order to initiate a discussion about a new idea, they should [TBD] ~~send an email to the project contributors\u2019 list~~ start a discussion on the Boken Engine GitHub repository or submit a patch implementing the idea to the issue tracker. This will prompt a review and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this review and discussion is to gain approval for the contribution. Since most people in the project community have a shared vision, there is often little need for discussion in order to reach consensus. In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is recognised as having the support of the community. This is called lazy consensus - that is, those who have not stated their opinion explicitly have implicitly agreed to the implementation of the proposal. Lazy consensus is a very important concept within the project. It is this process that allows a large group of people to efficiently reach consensus, as someone with no objections to a proposal need not spend time stating their position, and others need not spend time reading such mails. For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least [TBD] 72 hours before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the proposal. This time period is chosen so as to be as inclusive as possible of all participants, regardless of their location and time commitments.","title":"Lazy consensus"},{"location":"sample_conclusions/proposal_governance_liberal/#voting","text":"Not all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. Issues such as those affecting the strategic direction or legal standing of the project must gain explicit approval in the form of a vote. Every member of the community is encouraged to express their opinions in all discussion and all votes. However, only project committers and/or PMC members (as defined above) have binding votes for the purposes of decision making. The following is a more detailed description of how voting is conducted in projects following the practice established within the Apache Software Foundation. [TBD] If a formal vote on a proposal is called (signaled simply by sending a email with \u2018[VOTE]\u2019 in the subject line), all participants on the project contributors\u2019 list may express an opinion and vote. They do this by sending an email in reply to the original \u2018[VOTE]\u2019 email, with the following vote and information: +1 \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018agree\u2019: also willing to help bring about the proposed action +0 \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018agree\u2019: not willing or able to help bring about the proposed action -0 \u2018no\u2019, \u2018disagree\u2019: but will not oppose the action\u2019s going forward -1 \u2018no\u2019, \u2018disagree\u2019: opposes the action\u2019s going forward and must propose an alternative action to address the issue (or a justification for not addressing the issue) To abstain from the vote, participants simply do not respond ~~to the email~~. However, it can be more helpful to cast a \u2018+0\u2019 or \u2018-0\u2019 than to abstain, since this allows the team to gauge the general feeling of the community if the proposal should be controversial. Every member of the community, from interested user to the most active developer, has a vote. The project encourages all members to express their opinions in all discussion and all votes. However, only some members have binding votes for the purposes of decision making; for example in the Apache Software Foundation these are the committers and/or the members of the Project Management Committee. It is therefore their responsibility to ensure that the opinions of all community members are considered. While not all members may have a binding vote, a well-justified \u2018-1\u2019 from a non-committer must be considered by the community, and if appropriate, supported by a binding \u2018-1\u2019. A \u2018-1\u2019 can also indicate a veto, depending on the type of vote and who is using it. Someone without a binding vote cannot veto a proposal, so in their case a -1 would simply indicate an objection. When a [VOTE] receives a \u2018-1\u2019, it is the responsibility of the community as a whole to address the objection. Such discussion will continue until the objection is either rescinded, overruled (in the case of a non-binding veto) or the proposal itself is altered in order to achieve consensus (possibly by withdrawing it altogether). In the rare circumstance that consensus cannot be achieved, the PMC will decide the forward course of action. In summary: - Those who don\u2019t agree with the proposal and think they have a better idea should vote -1 and defend their counter-proposal. - Those who don\u2019t agree but don\u2019t have a better idea should vote -0. - Those who agree but will not actively assist in implementing the proposal should vote +0. - Those who agree and will actively assist in implementing the proposal should vote +1.","title":"Voting"},{"location":"sample_conclusions/proposal_governance_liberal/#types-of-approval","text":"Different actions require different types of approval, ranging from lazy consensus to a majority decision by the PMC.

End-Users or End-consumers They are the users and consumers of the content created with our project\u2019s software by the User Creators.`` Motivations of Contributors in Open-Source Software Projects The motivations to contribute to Open Source (OSS) Software projects are quite different and are the following as portrayed in the paper \u201cCarrots and Rainbows: Motivation and Social Practice in OSS Development\u201d by von Krogh, et. Al, 2012. Such motivations can be group into the following main categories: Intrinsic motivations (performed for the inherent joy of participating and contributing) a. Ideology: The believe and commitment to the purpose and nature of OSS: free to modify, etc. b. Altruism: A voluntary contribution that does good, is an end in itself and is not directed at gain. c. Kinship amity: Urge of people to help others in a community that they belong to. d. Enjoyment and fun: The playfulness and experimentation possibilities when contributing. Internalized Extrinsic Motivation (performed with an external result or purpose linked in a way to the project) a. Reputation: Refers to the reputation that is obtained through contributions made to a projectthat can be divided into peer reputation (within the community) and outside reputation (friends, relatives, and prestige awarded). b. Gift Economy/Reciprocity: Giving code in return for other code. c. Learning: The motive to improve or acquire new skills through OSS. d. Own \u2013 Use Value: When the OSS has direct user value for the contributors. Extrinsic (performed with a separable outcome not linked to the project) a. Career: When they want to signal their talent for all to see and inspect in hopes for new job opportunities. b. Pay: Up to 40% of contributors is paid to contribute to OSS projects in some studies. According to \u201cShifting Sands of Motivation: Revisiting What drives Contributors in Open Source\u201d by Gerosa, et al. (2021) the most prevalent motivators to contribute to OSS are: The most frequent reason to contribute being Learning, Fun, Altruism and Kinship. However, these authors made a point in their study that these shifted depending both on the demographics as well as the experience with OSS projects. Early-Stage and Late-Stage Motivators According to the \u201cShifting Sands of Motivation: Revisiting What drives Contributors in Open Source\u201d by Gerosa, et al. (2021), motivations differ depending on your profile, demographics, your experience, and your interest will shift over time. One of the reasons can be attached to the fact that today OSS enjoys a place of distinction in producing key technologies, bringing new learning and career opportunities to contributors but also OSS projects. Companies look at OSS project to find new talent. According to the authors there are considerable differences between novice contributors with few years contributing to OSS and the more experienced contributors whose motivation shifted from some motivators to others, specifically extrinsic motivators shifting to intrinsic. Novice OSS contributors for example were much likelier to join an OSS projects for learning purposes, fun, reputation, and career. More experienced OSS contributors though clearly displayed greater motivation for social and altruistic reasons as well as their ideology which were motivators for them to continue adding to OSS projects. Core Team\u2019s Scope of Influence At the beginning our core team\u2019s reach will be that of the different communities of contributors, as well as that of the User Creators who will actively use the software to develop their ideas and create content. We will have no control over the content that is created with our software and hence will focus our attention on catering to the Contributor group and that of the User Creators. Therefore, as mentioned in our basic best practices research, we will have to focus on specific points to lower the Contributor and User Creator entry barriers to our project and take into consideration the different motivations of these groups for contributing to or using our project\u2019s software. Further questions to explore will be the elements for intrinsic and extrinsic motivations that make people contribute to an open-source project as well as the benefits that they derive from this. Current State of the Software Framework The current software can be described in one sentence as: \u201cFramework to create non-linear, slide-driven visual stories for IOS.\u201d The current features can be summed up as the following: Story contents described by a comprehensible JSON file. Decoupled architecture: no mess with code required. Extensible and customizable for advanced users. No configuration or customization needed: just the story contents and its assets are enough to create the app. Create your content with text areas, images, and rectangular shapes. Contents auto adjusted to device screen size. Background and scene-specific audio support. Gestures (swipes) support Landscape mode ready. The current user creator would have to download, install, and create content with it resulting in an independent app that would then have to be sent in, to the Apple Store for approval and listing. User Creator Entry and Usage Barrier At the current state of the software the User Creators profile requires a higher-than-average computer knowledge to install and run the software to create content apps with it. In addition, it does not allow to pre customize such settings or create templates without technical knowledge thus it can result a repetitive task, each time new content is to be created. User Creators Listing Barriers Even though unrelated to our software it is a reality that we have experienced ourselves and an area we will have to explore more once we design our demo project. It is a fact that if one\u2019s app does not meet the Apple Store\u2019s minimum requirements of content value for to end-users, the app will not get listed no matter how good and safe it is technically, so that we will have to learn ourselves from this exercise and then document it too for the community to help them achieve the goal of getting their application listed. 1.2.3 Creation of Value for the User Creators vs Creation of Value for End-Users The value that each type of user derives from our software are different since each group has different goals and objectives when using it. User Creators Value If we look at the User Creators, we first need to address the following questions to better understand this stakeholder. Some questions to ask when looking at the User Creators: What creates value for the User Creators? Which needs does he/she have? What problems does he normally face? What would drive them to use our framework? Which are the features that our product would need to include to become even more attractive? End User Value The value that is generated for the End Users is to a great extent tied to the content of any applications that will be created with the help of our software. Given this, we must differentiate between what we can affect and what we cannot affect. The content for example will be dependent on the ideas of each of our User Creators. Things that we can affect and control to some extent are: Simple to use user interface. User customization options. Range of possible features that are available for the use of the application. Potential Use Cases of the Project\u2019s Software We did different thought exercises both individually as well as groups to come up with a list of potential use cases for the software asking the following questions: A. What are obvious possible use cases at the current state of the software? B. What are the possible use cases with a few additional features to create everyday usage and value? C. What app would we create to provide daily direct value for someone like us? Hereafter we consider these use cases from a different perspective of value creation and went through a set of questions to establish the most feasible. Are there currently better options for the same purpose? Would we use it as creators? Would we use it as end users? What benefit would we derive from it? Would it be difficult to be used? Do the current features justify it to be a native app rather than a website? If not, which features are needed? Exercise A: What are the possible use cases at the current state of the software? The initial brainstorming\u2019s use cases resulted in the following list: As of right now from going over this list one can infer that many of the possible use cases are already served by other existing non app related technologies, such as PDF or websites. The creation of catalogues, maintenance instructions do not take advantage of the nonlinear nor sound features of our product. Which would leave the following initial use case list as the likelier ones making use of most of the current features and with a potential frequent to high usage and interaction. Exercise B: What are the possible use cases with a few additional features to create everyday usage and value? Some additional features that could drive additional value and increase usage rate would be for example: Notifications: Updates of new content availability for download, reminders for study, etc. Marking pages to easily go back to them: Quickly and easily go back to a location or save the content for later review. Uploading new content in the app: Possibility to expand the content easily without having to install a new app. Menu & Index: Better overview of available content, trial content, marked pages, etc. Possibility to buy additional content through the app: Content from the same app author. These additional features also expand the use case possibilities for our software. Questions resulting from these possible features are: Can they easily be implemented? Which will provide the highest return through the least effort? Exercise C: What app would we create to provide daily direct value for someone like us using this software or slightly amplifying it? Keeping in mind the following questions we proceeded to consider a slightly broader range of application use cases: What could we create that could generate daily value for the end-user with this software? What generates value for the User Creator? What generates value for the User Creator or content creator? Are there currently better options for the same purpose? Would we use it as creators? Would we use it as end users? What benefit would we derive from it? Would it be difficult to be used? What other apps exist that do something similar? Do the current features justify it to be a native app rather than a website? If not, which features are needed? Value increase for User Creators (Content Creators) A UI for visually editing, or at least aiding, on the creation of the content description JSON would add significant value to the application, as it would reduce the errors when editing it and would speed up the content creation, as the creator would not have to \u201ctry\u201d position and scale values. Although this is a feature aimed directly to the content creator, I would generate also indirect benefit to the end-user, as it would increase the repository of available applications. Additionally, an automation system to completely create the final App with no need for writing code would increase the value of the App. Combined with the previously commented content creation UI, would offer the user a fully visual app creation from end to end. This system would imply automatic code generation and building in a back-end using the XCode commands, increasing the engine complexity. Also, additional elements would be very useful for both content creators and end-user to increase the appeal of the final applications. Some examples would be video elements, animated GIFs or standard symbols. Also, increasing the possibilities of currently supported elements would be very interesting (i.e. Selecting font families or adjusting image lightness) Would we use it as creators? A trained developer would not a visual interface, since for him it would be easier to create the final content using directly the XCode features. Would we use it as end user? If the created content is interesting enough, of course. It depends completely on the content. Are there currently better options for the same purpose? What other apps exist that do something similar? There are plenty of similar Apps with an integrated UI, like this, this or this. The main difference is that Boken Engine is a source code framework (not a standalone application) that is integrated in a host application, and therefore can be a part of a broader project. However, there are other libraries for a similar purpose, like the extremely popular Ren\u2019Py. What benefit would we derive from it? The main interest a developer could have to use it, instead of using easier alternatives, is that, as stated previously, this can be integrated in a huge application, and as it has a decoupled and open architecture, can be mixed up with other libraries and frameworks to achieve a more powerful visual narrative application than use it individually. For example a developer can use only a part of it (i.e. only the SceneManager and StoryParser, but construct the slides themselves with another engine) or combine some of its features with the features of other libraries, or extend/modify it depending on his/her necessities. Do the current features justify it to be a native app rather than a website? The current features don\u2019t justify being a native app, but future developments could add some features very difficult to achieve via website (even PWAs). Personas within Our Scope of Influence Taking into consideration the different use cases and the current state of the software we tried to create a simplified overview of the four potential personas. Three current and one potential future user if the app were completely upgraded. At this point in time we perceive developers to be the main objective users as well as contributors until the project gains traction. In addition to this we also created the other extreme of the potential user in the future of a finished app made for Visual User Stories to get a first insight into the requirements that may have to be met and developed in the future and which need to be included in a road map.

(2021), motivations differ depending on your profile, demographics, your experience, and your interest will shift over time. One of the reasons can be attached to the fact that today OSS enjoys a place of distinction in producing key technologies, bringing new learning and career opportunities to contributors but also OSS projects. Companies look at OSS project to find new talent. According to the authors there are considerable differences between novice contributors with few years contributing to OSS and the more experienced contributors whose motivation shifted from some motivators to others, specifically extrinsic motivators shifting to intrinsic. Novice OSS contributors for example were much likelier to join an OSS projects for learning purposes, fun, reputation, and career. More experienced OSS contributors though clearly displayed greater motivation for social and altruistic reasons as well as their ideology which were motivators for them to continue adding to OSS projects.","title":"Early-Stage and Late-Stage Motivators"},{"location":"sample_conclusions/use-cases-and-communities/#core-teams-scope-of-influence","text":"At the beginning our core team\u2019s reach will be that of the different communities of contributors, as well as that of the User Creators who will actively use the software to develop their ideas and create content.

These additional features also expand the use case possibilities for our software. Questions resulting from these possible features are: Can they easily be implemented? Which will provide the highest return through the least effort? Exercise C: What app would we create to provide daily direct value for someone like us using this software or slightly amplifying it? Keeping in mind the following questions we proceeded to consider a slightly broader range of application use cases: What could we create that could generate daily value for the end-user with this software? What generates value for the User Creator? What generates value for the User Creator or content creator? Are there currently better options for the same purpose? Would we use it as creators? Would we use it as end users? What benefit would we derive from it? Would it be difficult to be used? What other apps exist that do something similar? Do the current features justify it to be a native app rather than a website? If not, which features are needed? Value increase for User Creators (Content Creators) A UI for visually editing, or at least aiding, on the creation of the content description JSON would add significant value to the application, as it would reduce the errors when editing it and would speed up the content creation, as the creator would not have to \u201ctry\u201d position and scale values. Although this is a feature aimed directly to the content creator, I would generate also indirect benefit to the end-user, as it would increase the repository of available applications. Additionally, an automation system to completely create the final App with no need for writing code would increase the value of the App. Combined with the previously commented content creation UI, would offer the user a fully visual app creation from end to end. This system would imply automatic code generation and building in a back-end using the XCode commands, increasing the engine complexity. Also, additional elements would be very useful for both content creators and end-user to increase the appeal of the final applications. Some examples would be video elements, animated GIFs or standard symbols. Also, increasing the possibilities of currently supported elements would be very interesting (i.e. Selecting font families or adjusting image lightness) Would we use it as creators? A trained developer would not a visual interface, since for him it would be easier to create the final content using directly the XCode features. Would we use it as end user? If the created content is interesting enough, of course. It depends completely on the content. Are there currently better options for the same purpose? What other apps exist that do something similar? There are plenty of similar Apps with an integrated UI, like this, this or this. The main difference is that Boken Engine is a source code framework (not a standalone application) that is integrated in a host application, and therefore can be a part of a broader project. However, there are other libraries for a similar purpose, like the extremely popular Ren\u2019Py. What benefit would we derive from it? The main interest a developer could have to use it, instead of using easier alternatives, is that, as stated previously, this can be integrated in a huge application, and as it has a decoupled and open architecture, can be mixed up with other libraries and frameworks to achieve a more powerful visual narrative application than use it individually. For example a developer can use only a part of it (i.e. only the SceneManager and StoryParser, but construct the slides themselves with another engine) or combine some of its features with the features of other libraries, or extend/modify it depending on his/her necessities. Do the current features justify it to be a native app rather than a website? The current features don\u2019t justify being a native app, but future developments could add some features very difficult to achieve via website (even PWAs).","title":"Exercise B: What are the possible use cases with a few additional features to create everyday usage and value?"},{"location":"sample_conclusions/use-cases-and-communities/#personas-within-our-scope-of-influence","text":"Taking into consideration the different use cases and the current state of the software we tried to create a simplified overview of the four potential personas.

Preamble The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work. A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\". A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 14. Revised Versions of this License The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16 If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.

This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.","title":"6.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.

Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public . Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\").

Section 1 \u2013 Definitions a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 \u2013 Scope a. License grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. Downstream recipients. A. Offer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. B. Additional offer from the Licensor \u2013 Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter\u2019s License You apply. C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 \u2013 License Conditions Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. b. ShareAlike. In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply. The Adapter\u2019s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply. Section 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 \u2013 Interpretation a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Non-Goals The NCCA is not a copyright assignment agreement. The NCCA does not somehow supersede the existing licensing terms that apply to Nautilus contributions. There are two important subpoints here. First, the NCCA does not apply to upstream code (or other material) that you didn't write; indeed, it would be preposterous for it to attempt to do so. Note the narrow way in which we have defined capital-c \"Contribution\". Second, the main provision of the NCCA specifies that a default license will apply to code that you wrote, but only to the extent that you have not bothered to put an explicit license on it. Therefore, the NCCA is not some sort of special permissive license granted to any party, despite the explicit choice of a more restrictive license by you or by upstream developers. Terms Section 1 \u2013 Definitions \"Acceptable License For Nautilus\" means a license selected from the appropriate categorical sublist of the full list of acceptable licenses for Nautilus, currently located at https://nautilus-cyberneering.de/licensing/ , as that list may be revised from time to time by Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH. \"Acceptable Licenses For Nautilus\" means that full list. \"AGPLv3\" means the license identified as \"Affero General Public License 3.0\", as published at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html . \"CC-0\" means the Creative Commons 1.0 Universal license, as published at https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode . \"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license, as published at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode . \"Code\" means (i) software code, (ii) any other functional material whose principal purpose is to control or facilitate the building of packages, such as an RPM spec file, (iii) font files, and (iv) other kinds of copyrightable material that the Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH has classified as \"code\" rather than \"content\". \"Content\" means any copyrightable material that is not Code, such as, without limitation, (i) non-functional data sets, (ii) documentation, (iii) wiki edits, (iv) music files, (v) graphic image files, (vi) help files, and (vii) other kinds of copyrightable material that the Nautilus Council has classified as \"content\" rather than \"code\". \"Contribution\" means a Work that You created, excluding any portion that was created by someone else. (For example, if You Submit a package to Nautilus, the spec file You write may be a Contribution, but all the upstream code in the associated Package that You did not write is not a Contribution for purposes of this NCCA.) A Contribution consists either of Code or of Content. \"Current Default License\" , with respect to a Contribution, means (i) if the Contribution is Code, the AGPLv3 License, and (ii) if the Contribution is Content, CC-BY-SA. \"Future Public Domain License\" , with respect to a Contribution, means (i) if the Contribution is Code, the MIT-0 License, and (ii) if the Contribution is Content, CC-0. \"Licensed\" means covered by explicit licensing terms that are conspicuous and readily discernible to recipients. \"Submit\" means to use some mode of digital communication (for example, without limitation, mailing lists, bug tracking systems, and source code version control systems administered by Nautilus) to voluntarily provide a Contribution to Nautilus. \"Unlicensed\" means not Licensed. \"MIT-0\" means the license identified as \"MIT No Attribution\", as published at https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT-0 . \"Nautilus\" means the community project led by the Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH https://nautilus-cyberneering.de/ . \"Nautilus Community\" means (i) all Nautilus participants, and (ii) all persons receiving Contributions directly or indirectly from or through Nautilus. \"Work\" means a copyrightable work of authorship.

One form of such authorization is for the copyright holder to place, or permit You to place, an Acceptable License For Nautilus on the Contribution. Section 4 \u2013 Licensed Contributions If Your Contribution is Licensed, Your Contribution will be governed by the terms under which it has been licensed. Section 5 \u2013 Default Licensing of Unlicensed Contributions If You Submit an Unlicensed Contribution to Nautilus, the license to the Nautilus Community for that Contribution shall be the Current Default License. The Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH may, by public announcement, subsequently designate an additional or alternative default license for a given category of Contribution (a \"Later Default License\").

Effective Date The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution. 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor: (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions. This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4). 2.4.

Conditions Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1. 3. Responsibilities 3.1. Distribution of Source Form All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form. 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License. 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s). 3.4. Notices You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 3.5. Application of Additional Terms You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Termination 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice. 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate. 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination. * Disclaimer of Warranty * ------------------------- * * Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" * basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or * statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the * Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a * particular purpose or non-infringing.

This * limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or * personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the * extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some * jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of * incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and * limitation may not apply to You. * * 8. Litigation Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims. 9. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. 10.

The code in the repository is the XCode project of the framework, and therefore, cannot be used directly to generate an iOS App. Boken Engine is neither an iOS Application, a library nor a package. All contributions must respect the identity of the project and do not add anything that infringe it (i.e. making the project contents-specific, coupling it to a particular App or preventing it to be reusable as a framework) How can I contribute? Bug reporting Before creating bug reports, please check if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. If the problem hasn't been reported, create a new GitHub issue , providing the following information: A clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem. A description of the steps which reproduce the problem , as detailed as possible. Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and why that behaviour is erroneous or unexpected. If possible, include screenshots and animated GIFs New features suggestion Features / improvement suggestions are submitted as GitHub issues . Please, before submitting a new one, please check if the improvement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. When creating a improvement issue, please provide the following information: Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion. Provide a description of the suggested enhancement as detailed as possible Explain why this improvement would be useful to most users Committing code to an issue Before writing any code for the repository, please review the Swift styleguides. Please, check that the new code will not compromise the quality, stability or security of the codebase. Any new code is added to the repository using Pull Requests that must be reviewed and approved by the community before being merged or rebased to the repository. When creating the commit and the pull request, please refer also to the section Issues, Commits and Pull Requests. Whenever is possible, new features should have Unit Tests to maintain (or increase) the code test coverage before adding it. Additional documentation New documentation contributions are also welcomed. They can improve the official documentation, add new examples or tutorials. The new documents must be added to the \"docs\" folder, and they must be created or modified using the same issue - pull request method as the code contributions. Document format should be MarkDown unless an alternative format is really necessary. Naming should adhere to underscore kebab-case . Styleguides - (NOTE: Must be customized for each project) Swift styleguide Fundamentals Clarity at the point of use is your most important goal. Clarity is more important than brevity Projects should not throw any warnings when built. Conventions Prefer methods and properties to free functions. Prefer to locate parameters with defaults toward the end. Conditional code checks \"the golden path\" (the most probable option) first. Inverted checks (like !incorrect) are discouraged because of poor readability. Use argument labels (unless not useful or part of a grammatical phrase) If possible, avoid any type. Use self only when required by the compiler (i.e. disambiguate properties from arguments in initializers) Code editing Use 2 blank spaces block indent Indentation is made with whitespaces, not with tabs Semicolons (;) are not used, either to terminate or separate statements. Annotations go onto a separate line before the declaration. Use OTBS brackets style Naming Include all the words needed to avoid ambiguity, but omit needless words Name entities according to their roles, rather than their type constraints. Names of types and protocols are UpperCamelCase. Everything else is lowerCamelCase. Declarations should form correct human-readable phrases when read aloud. Methods without side-effects have noun names (originalSize()). Methods with side effects have imperative verb names (sort()). Non-mutating methods that return new values have past participle names (sorted()) or a noun if the operation is naturally described by it (union()) Protocols that describe what something is should read as nouns (Collection). Protocols that describe a capability should be named using -able, -ible, or -ing (Equatable, ProgressReporting). Avoid abbreviations Comments Self-documented code is preferred over comments. When completely needed, comments must be written using double slash (//) instead of block syntax (/ ... /). Comments must be kept up-to-date or deleted. Public APIs should have HeaderDoc documentation using JavaDoc standards. Imports All imports go alphabetically sorted at the very beginning of the file. Empty lines between imports are not used. Import only the modules a source file requires. Do not insert a blank line between imports. Documentation styleguide Documentation should use MarkDown (.md) format. It must be written at least in English, but additional localized versions are also possible. Issues, commits and Pull Requests Each pull request for new commits must be related to a particular issue, and will be reviewed by the community before being merged or rebased to the codebase.

That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the benevolent dictator. In case of disagreement, they have the last word. It is the benevolent dictator\u2019s job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community\u2019s job to guide the decisions of the benevolent dictator through active engagement and contribution. Roles And Responsibilities Benevolent dictator (project lead) Typically, the benevolent dictator, or project lead, is self-appointed. However, because the community always has the ability to fork, this person is fully answerable to the community. The project lead\u2019s role is a difficult one: they set the strategic objectives of the project and communicate these clearly to the community. They also have to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, while ensuring that the project survives in the long term. In many ways, the role of the benevolent dictator is less about dictatorship and more about diplomacy. The key is to ensure that, as the project expands, the right people are given influence over it and the community rallies behind the vision of the project lead. The lead\u2019s job is then to ensure that the committers (see below) make the right decisions on behalf of the project. Generally speaking, as long as the committers are aligned with the project\u2019s strategy, the project lead will allow them to proceed as they desire. Committers Committers are contributors who have made several valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. In many cases they are programmers but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role. Typically, a committer will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project lead. The role of committer is not an official one, it is simply a position that influential members of the community will find themselves in as the project lead looks to them for guidance and support. Committers have no authority over the overall direction of the project. However, they do have the ear of the project lead. It is a committer\u2019s job to ensure that the lead is aware of the community\u2019s needs and collective objectives, and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. Often, committers are given informal control over their specific areas of responsibility, and are assigned rights to directly modify certain areas of the source code. That is, although committers do not have explicit decision-making authority, they will often find that their actions are synonymous with the decisions made by the lead. Contributors Contributors are community members who either have no desire to become committers, or have not yet been given the opportunity by the benevolent dictator. They make valuable contributions, such as those outlined in the list below, but generally do not have the authority to make direct changes to the project code. Contributors engage with the project through issues in the issue tracker. Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project. Some contributors will already be engaging with the project as users, but will also find themselves doing one or more of the following: supporting new users (current users often provide the most effective new user support) reporting bugs identifying requirements supplying graphics and web design programming assisting with project infrastructure writing documentation fixing bugs adding features As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, they may find that the project lead starts relying on them more and more. When this begins to happen, they gradually adopt the role of committer, as described above. Users Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements. Users should be encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user activities include (but are not limited to): evangelising about the project informing developers of project strengths and weaknesses from a new user\u2019s perspective providing moral support (a \u2018thank you\u2019 goes a long way) providing financial support Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become contributors, as described above. Support All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new users within the project management infrastructure. This support is provided as a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognise that all support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as and when time allows. A user requiring guaranteed response times or results should therefore seek to purchase a support contract from a vendor. (Of course, that vendor should be an active member of the community.) However, for those willing to engage with the project on its own terms, and willing to help support other users, the community support channels are ideal. Contribution Process Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are many ways to contribute. For instance, a contributor might be active on the issue tracker, or might supply patches. The various ways of contributing are described in more detail in CONTRIBUTING . The issue tracker is the most appropriate place for a contributor to ask for help when making their first contribution. Decision-Making Process The benevolent dictatorship model does not need a formal conflict resolution process, since the project lead\u2019s word is final. If the community chooses to question the wisdom of the actions of a committer, the project lead can review their decisions by checking the email archives, and either uphold or reverse them.","title":"Governance"},{"location":"templates_repository_starting/GOVERNANCE_BD/#governance","text":"","title":"Governance"},{"location":"templates_repository_starting/GOVERNANCE_BD/#overview","text":"This project is led by a benevolent dictator and managed by the community.

Non-Goals The NCCA is not a copyright assignment agreement. The NCCA does not somehow supersede the existing licensing terms that apply to Nautilus contributions. There are two important subpoints here. First, the NCCA does not apply to upstream code (or other material) that you didn't write; indeed, it would be preposterous for it to attempt to do so. Note the narrow way in which we have defined capital-c \"Contribution\". Second, the main provision of the NCCA specifies that a default license will apply to code that you wrote, but only to the extent that you have not bothered to put an explicit license on it. Therefore, the NCCA is not some sort of special permissive license granted to any party, despite the explicit choice of a more restrictive license by you or by upstream developers. Terms Section 1 \u2013 Definitions \"Acceptable License For Nautilus\" means a license selected from the appropriate categorical sublist of the full list of acceptable licenses for Nautilus, currently located at https://nautilus-cyberneering.de/licensing/ , as that list may be revised from time to time by Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH. \"Acceptable Licenses For Nautilus\" means that full list. \"AGPLv3\" means the license identified as \"Affero General Public License 3.0\", as published at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html . \"CC-0\" means the Creative Commons 1.0 Universal license, as published at https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode . \"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license, as published at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode . \"Code\" means (i) software code, (ii) any other functional material whose principal purpose is to control or facilitate the building of packages, such as an RPM spec file, (iii) font files, and (iv) other kinds of copyrightable material that the Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH has classified as \"code\" rather than \"content\". \"Content\" means any copyrightable material that is not Code, such as, without limitation, (i) non-functional data sets, (ii) documentation, (iii) wiki edits, (iv) music files, (v) graphic image files, (vi) help files, and (vii) other kinds of copyrightable material that the Nautilus Council has classified as \"content\" rather than \"code\". \"Contribution\" means a Work that You created, excluding any portion that was created by someone else. (For example, if You Submit a package to Nautilus, the spec file You write may be a Contribution, but all the upstream code in the associated Package that You did not write is not a Contribution for purposes of this NCCA.) A Contribution consists either of Code or of Content. \"Current Default License\" , with respect to a Contribution, means (i) if the Contribution is Code, the AGPLv3 License, and (ii) if the Contribution is Content, CC-BY-SA. \"Future Public Domain License\" , with respect to a Contribution, means (i) if the Contribution is Code, the MIT-0 License, and (ii) if the Contribution is Content, CC-0. \"Licensed\" means covered by explicit licensing terms that are conspicuous and readily discernible to recipients. \"Submit\" means to use some mode of digital communication (for example, without limitation, mailing lists, bug tracking systems, and source code version control systems administered by Nautilus) to voluntarily provide a Contribution to Nautilus. \"Unlicensed\" means not Licensed. \"MIT-0\" means the license identified as \"MIT No Attribution\", as published at https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT-0 . \"Nautilus\" means the community project led by the Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH https://nautilus-cyberneering.de/ . \"Nautilus Community\" means (i) all Nautilus participants, and (ii) all persons receiving Contributions directly or indirectly from or through Nautilus. \"Work\" means a copyrightable work of authorship. A Work may be a portion of a larger Work, and a Work may be a modification of or addition to another Work. \"You\" means the individual accepting this instance of the NCCA. Section 2 \u2013 List of Acceptable Licenses for Nautilus CC-BY-SA CC-0 AGPLv3 MIT-0 Section 3 \u2013 Copyright Permission Required for All Contributions If You are not the copyright holder of a given Contribution that You wish to Submit to Nautilus (for example, if Your employer or university holds copyright in it), it is Your responsibility to first obtain authorization from the copyright holder to Submit the Contribution under the terms of this NCCA on behalf of, or otherwise with the permission of, that copyright holder. One form of such authorization is for the copyright holder to place, or permit You to place, an Acceptable License For Nautilus on the Contribution. Section 4 \u2013 Licensed Contributions If Your Contribution is Licensed, Your Contribution will be governed by the terms under which it has been licensed. Section 5 \u2013 Default Licensing of Unlicensed Contributions If You Submit an Unlicensed Contribution to Nautilus, the license to the Nautilus Community for that Contribution shall be the Current Default License. The Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH may, by public announcement, subsequently designate an additional or alternative default license for a given category of Contribution (a \"Later Default License\"). A Later Default License shall be chosen from the appropriate categorical sublist of Acceptable Licenses For Nautilus. Once a Later Default License has been designated, Your Unlicensed Contribution shall also be licensed to the Nautilus Community under that Later Default License. Such designation shall not affect the continuing applicability of the Current Default License to Your Contribution. You consent to having Nautilus provide reasonable notice of Your licensing of Your Contribution under the Current Default License (and, if applicable, a Later Default License) in a manner determined by Nautilus. Section 6 \u2013 Automatic Future Public Domain License You consent that your contribution under the Current Default License is granted the Future Public Domain License automatically after 5 years of submission. Section 7 \u2013 Public Domain United States Government Works Sections 3 through 6 of this NCCA do not apply to any Contribution to the extent that it is a work of the United States Government for which copyright is unavailable under 17 U.S.C. 105.

The NCCA does not somehow supersede the existing licensing terms that apply to Nautilus contributions. There are two important subpoints here. First, the NCCA does not apply to upstream code (or other material) that you didn't write; indeed, it would be preposterous for it to attempt to do so. Note the narrow way in which we have defined capital-c \"Contribution\". Second, the main provision of the NCCA specifies that a default license will apply to code that you wrote, but only to the extent that you have not bothered to put an explicit license on it. Therefore, the NCCA is not some sort of special permissive license granted to any party, despite the explicit choice of a more restrictive license by you or by upstream developers.","title":"Non-Goals"},{"location":"templates_repository_starting/contributor_agreement_v01/#terms","text":"","title":"Terms"},{"location":"templates_repository_starting/contributor_agreement_v01/#section-1-definitions","text":"\"Acceptable License For Nautilus\" means a license selected from the appropriate categorical sublist of the full list of acceptable licenses for Nautilus, currently located at https://nautilus-cyberneering.de/licensing/ , as that list may be revised from time to time by Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH. \"Acceptable Licenses For Nautilus\" means that full list. \"AGPLv3\" means the license identified as \"Affero General Public License 3.0\", as published at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html . \"CC-0\" means the Creative Commons 1.0 Universal license, as published at https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode . \"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license, as published at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode . \"Code\" means (i) software code, (ii) any other functional material whose principal purpose is to control or facilitate the building of packages, such as an RPM spec file, (iii) font files, and (iv) other kinds of copyrightable material that the Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH has classified as \"code\" rather than \"content\". \"Content\" means any copyrightable material that is not Code, such as, without limitation, (i) non-functional data sets, (ii) documentation, (iii) wiki edits, (iv) music files, (v) graphic image files, (vi) help files, and (vii) other kinds of copyrightable material that the Nautilus Council has classified as \"content\" rather than \"code\". \"Contribution\" means a Work that You created, excluding any portion that was created by someone else.
